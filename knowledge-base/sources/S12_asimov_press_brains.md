# S12: "Building Brains on a Computer" (Asimov Press)

**Source:** Max Schons, MD — Asimov Press (press.asimov.com/articles/brains)
**Type:** Accessible companion article to S11's technical report. Same author, same topic, written for general audience.
**Credibility:** Same as S11 — credentialed author, institutional backing.
**Relevance:** Same as S11 — conceptual background, not directly actionable for our agent build. But this article adds concrete timelines, costs, and one additional insight.

### S12 — Extracted Items

| # | Item | Tags | Relevance | Notes |
|---|------|------|-----------|-------|
| S12.01 | **Brain emulators vs AI simulators** — emulators replicate neural architecture (bottom-up), simulators mimic behavior through different mechanisms (top-down). "What I cannot create, I do not understand" (Feynman). | `ARCH` | LOW | Reinforces S11.05. We're building a simulator (behavioral AI), not an emulator (neural replication). This is fine for our purposes. |
| S12.02 | **Concrete timelines: zebrafish/fly 3-8 years ($100M), mouse 2030s ($1B), human late 2040s ($10B+)** — with "10x costs and ten additional years" error margin. | `COMMUNITY` | LOW | Context for where the field is. Human brain emulation is 20+ years away at minimum. Our practical agent-building approach is the correct strategy for now and the foreseeable future. |
| S12.03 | **"AI will provide extraordinary acceleration in some places" but biology involves "physical manipulation with time requirements dictated by chemistry and physics rather than compute"** — AI can't speed up everything. | `ARCH` | MEDIUM | Transfers to our agent: some tasks are acceleratable by AI (content generation, research, code), others aren't (building relationships with customers, shipping physical products, child development milestones). Baby Brains' value is in human development knowledge — AI accelerates the delivery, not the science. |
| S12.04 | **First brain emulations will be generic, not personality-preserving** — aggregating data from multiple organisms, not capturing individual identity. | `AUTONOMY` `MEMORY` | MEDIUM | Interesting contrast with our approach. Our agent IS individual from day one — shaped by personal memories, specific context, unique interaction patterns. We don't need to aggregate across users; we build depth with ONE user. This is an advantage of behavioral AI over emulation: individuality is easy for us, hard for them. |

### S12 — Combined Assessment (S11 + S12)

These two sources together (the technical report and its accessible companion) give us a grounding perspective:

**What we're building vs what "real" intelligence would be:**

| Dimension | Brain Emulation | Our Agent | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architecture | 86 billion neurons, trillions of synapses | LLM + retrieval + tools | Vast |
| Memory | Distributed across neural connections | SQLite + semantic memory + knowledge base | Functionally useful, architecturally simple |
| Learning | Changes synaptic weights through experience | Stores memories, adjusts context, accumulates knowledge | Similar outcome, different mechanism |
| Individuality | Emerges from unique neural development | Emerges from unique interaction history | Both produce unique entities |
| Timeline | Decades | Now | Our advantage |
| Cost | $10B+ for human | $30-100/month | Our advantage |

**The practical conclusion:** We don't need brain emulation to build a useful, evolving, personal AI assistant. What we need is good architecture (MCP, intent dispatch, model routing), good data (Baby Brains knowledge base, user memories), and good interaction design (Love Equation, proactive behavior). Brain emulation is the long game; we're playing the short game that delivers value NOW.

**But keep watching:** If/when brain emulation achieves zebrafish-level success (3-8 years), the principles will inform how we think about agent memory, learning, and individuality. File this as background knowledge, not action items.
