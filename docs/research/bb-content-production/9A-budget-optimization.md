# Prompt 9A: Sub-$100/month AI Video Production Stacks (2026)

Research the most cost-effective tool stacks for producing 25-35 stylized 3D animated short-form videos per month on a budget under $100/month, as of February 2026:

1. Find REAL creators who produce this volume at this budget:
   - What's their exact tool stack?
   - Monthly costs broken down by tool
   - How they optimize for cost (batch processing, free tier exploitation, etc.)
2. Free/open-source alternatives:
   - Are there any FREE video generation tools viable for production use?
   - Open-source image-to-video tools that run on RTX 3050 Ti 4GB?
   - Free hosting/serving of any models via HuggingFace Spaces or similar?
3. Subscription optimization:
   - Which tools have the best free tiers for supplementing paid tools?
   - Are there annual subscription discounts worth considering?
   - Student/creator discounts available?
4. Workflow that MINIMIZES paid video generation:
   - Could you generate more with MJ images + ken burns/parallax effects instead of full AI video?
   - What percentage of content actually NEEDS full AI video vs animated stills?
   - Are there hybrid workflows (AI image + simple motion in CapCut) that produce good results?
5. Calculate THREE specific stacks:
   - Stack A: Minimum viable (~$40-50/month)
   - Stack B: Recommended balance (~$70-80/month)
   - Stack C: Premium quality (~$100-120/month)
   - For each: exact tools, exact tier, exact monthly cost, expected monthly output, known limitations

Provide all pricing links and real user references with dates.
