# Prompt 5A: AI Content Policy Across All Target Platforms (February 2026)

Research the CURRENT (as of February 2026) policies for AI-generated content on TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook:

1. TikTok:
   - Current synthetic media policy (exact text or summary from official source)
   - Latest enforcement statistics (any updates since the 51,618 removals figure from late 2025?)
   - Is stylized/animated AI content EXPLICITLY exempt from labeling? Find the exact policy language.
   - Creator Rewards Program: still excluding AI content? Any changes?
   - C2PA metadata: does TikTok auto-detect and label? Current behavior?
   - Any new policies announced for 2026?
2. Instagram/Meta:
   - Current "AI Info" label policy
   - Does C2PA metadata from MidJourney trigger auto-labeling?
   - Algorithm impact of AI labels (suppression? neutral?)
   - Can you strip C2PA metadata before uploading? Is this against ToS?
3. YouTube:
   - Shorts-specific AI disclosure requirements
   - "Made for Kids" designation: how does this interact with AI content?
   - Monetization eligibility for AI-assisted content (current policy)
   - What qualifies as "meaningful human creative contribution"?
4. Facebook:
   - Any specific AI content policies?
   - Is there algorithm suppression of detected AI content?
5. For ALL platforms:
   - Is there any evidence that DISCLOSING AI use (proactively, with privacy-first framing) actually HELPS engagement vs hurts it?
   - Find case studies of creators who disclose AI use -- how does their engagement compare?
   - The anti-sharenting angle: does framing AI illustration as "protecting children's privacy" measurably improve audience trust?
