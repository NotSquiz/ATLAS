# Prompt 8A: MidJourney V7 Character Consistency & Video Prompting (2026)

Research the CURRENT state of MidJourney V7's character and style consistency features, and video prompting best practices, as of February 2026:

1. --cref (Character Reference):
   - Current behavior in V7 -- has it improved since launch?
   - Does --cref work for VIDEO generation or only images?
   - What --cw (character weight) values do experienced users recommend?
   - Common failure modes and workarounds
   - Can you maintain a consistent stylized 3D character across 20+ generations?
2. --sref (Style Reference):
   - Current behavior and best practices
   - Optimal --sw (style weight) values for maintaining a brand aesthetic
   - Can you use a color palette swatch as --sref?
   - How well does it maintain specific lighting/glow effects?
3. Omni-Reference:
   - What is it and how does it differ from --cref/--sref?
   - Is it better for maintaining style + character simultaneously?
4. Video generation specifics:
   - What prompt structure produces the best video results?
   - Maximum useful length before quality degrades
   - How to specify motion/camera movement
   - Success rate for video vs image generation
   - Any known limitations or bugs?
5. "Seed discipline":
   - Does using the same --seed improve consistency across generations?
   - Is this still relevant in V7?
6. Community best practices:
   - Search r/midjourney, MidJourney Discord community, YouTube tutorials
   - What workflow do power users follow for producing consistent characters?
   - Any MJ-specific techniques for stylized 3D / clay aesthetic?

Provide exact prompt examples with parameters, source URLs, and dates.
