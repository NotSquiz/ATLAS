# Prompt 3B: Voice Generation Tools for Australian Educational Content (2026)

Research CURRENT text-to-speech and voice cloning options as of February 2026, specifically for producing voiceover for Australian parenting educational content:

1. Kokoro TTS:
   - Current version and capabilities
   - VRAM requirements -- does it actually run on RTX 3050 Ti (4GB)?
   - Quality of British/Australian English voices
   - Any recent improvements or new models?
   - Speed and batch processing capabilities
2. ElevenLabs:
   - CURRENT pricing tiers (as of Feb 2026)
   - Voice cloning: minimum sample length, quality from short samples
   - How many minutes of generated voice per tier per month?
   - Can you clone an Australian accent reliably from a 10-second sample?
   - Any competitors that do voice cloning better/cheaper?
3. OTHER voice tools to consider:
   - CosyVoice: current state, VRAM requirements, Australian accent capability
   - Chatterbox: current state, capabilities
   - F5-TTS: VRAM requirements (will it run on 4GB?)
   - Fish Speech, StyleTTS, XTTS -- any that have improved significantly?
   - Any NEW voice tools launched in 2025-2026?
4. For each viable option, provide:
   - Monthly cost
   - Australian accent quality (native or approximation)
   - Batch processing capability
   - Hardware requirements (must run on RTX 3050 Ti 4GB or be affordable cloud)
5. Specific recommendation for:
   - Bulk daily content (20-30 VO tracks per month)
   - Premium "brand voice" content (2-4 hero videos per month)
   - What's the most cost-effective split between local and cloud tools?
