# Prompt 1C: Complete AI Video Tool Comparison (February 2026)

Create a comprehensive comparison of ALL viable AI video generation tools as of February 2026. I'm producing stylized 3D / clay-aesthetic short-form social content (not photorealistic). I need 20-35 videos per month at 7-60 seconds each.

For EACH tool, provide:
1. Name and current version
2. EXACT pricing (all tiers)
3. Credits/generations per month at each tier
4. Maximum video length
5. Character consistency features (reference images, Elements, etc.)
6. Audio generation capability
7. Image-to-video capability
8. Real user satisfaction ratings (find actual reviews, Reddit posts, YouTube comparisons)
9. SPECIFICALLY how well it handles stylized/non-photorealistic content
10. Cost per finished video (accounting for typical re-generation rates)

IMPORTANT: Do NOT limit your research to this list. Search comprehensively for ALL AI video generation tools available in February 2026. The AI video space moves extremely fast -- new tools launch monthly. Research every viable option.

Known tools to include (verify current state -- some may have changed dramatically):
- Kling AI (Kuaishou -- current version, check if still 2.6 or newer)
- Runway (current version -- Gen-4? Gen-5?)
- Luma Ray / Dream Machine (current version)
- Google Veo 3 / Veo 3.1 (standalone and through Gemini)
- Google Gemini video generation (through Gemini app/API directly)
- Grok Video (xAI -- what are its current capabilities?)
- OpenAI Sora (current version -- pricing, availability, quality)
- Hailuo AI / MiniMax (current version)
- Pika (current version)
- MidJourney Video (native video in MJ)
- Leonardo AI Motion (current version)
- Stable Video / Stability AI (current state -- still operational?)
- ByteDance Seedance (current version)
- VIDU (current version)
- Alibaba WAN (current version)
- Genmo (if still active)
- Haiper (if still active)
- ANY new tools launched in late 2025 or early 2026 that I haven't listed

For each tool that is ACTUALLY AVAILABLE (not just announced), calculate: "If I need 30 videos per month (mix of 7s, 15s, 21s, and 60s), what would my ACTUAL monthly spend be, accounting for re-generation waste?"

Also investigate:
- Which tools offer SUBSCRIPTION models (fixed monthly cost, unlimited or high-volume generation)?
- Which tools are per-credit/per-generation only?
- Which tools have free tiers that are actually useful for production (not just 3 test clips)?
- Are there any tools that specifically EXCEL at stylized/non-photorealistic animation?
- Are there any tools that can generate 30-60 second clips in a single generation (vs 5-10s that need stitching)?

Rank by: (1) cost-effectiveness for my volume, (2) quality for stylized 3D, (3) character consistency reliability, (4) subscription model availability (prefer predictable monthly cost over per-credit).

Provide specific URLs for all pricing pages, reviews, and comparisons cited. Include dates for all data points.
