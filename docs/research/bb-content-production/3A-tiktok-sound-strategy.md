# Prompt 3A: TikTok Sound Strategy for Animated/AI Content

Research the CURRENT best practices for audio/sound on TikTok specifically for animated/AI-generated educational content, as of early 2026:

1. TikTok sound behavior:
   - When you upload a video with your own audio, does TikTok allow users to "use this sound"?
   - When you add a trending sound in-app OVER your own video, what happens to your original audio?
   - Can you have BOTH original voiceover AND a trending sound playing simultaneously?
   - If you upload silent and add a trending sound, does this meaningfully improve distribution?
2. Data on sound vs silent:
   - What percentage of TikTok users watch with sound on vs off?
   - Does adding trending audio actually improve reach for educational content? Find real data/case studies.
   - Do educational/parenting accounts benefit from trending sounds, or does it feel inauthentic?
3. Voice/narration:
   - Is TikTok penalizing AI-generated voiceover? Any evidence of detection/suppression?
   - What voice style performs best for parenting educational content? (warm female, authoritative male, etc.)
   - Is Australian accent specifically an advantage or disadvantage on TikTok for this niche?
4. Music licensing:
   - Can commercial accounts use TikTok's built-in music library?
