# Prompt 1A: Kling AI Current Pricing & Real Costs

Research the CURRENT pricing structure for Kling AI as of February 2026. I need:

1. EXACT pricing tiers (Free, Pro, Premium, Enterprise -- whatever they currently offer)
2. What does each tier include? Specifically:
   - Number of video generations per month (or credits system)
   - Maximum video length per generation
   - Resolution options (SD, HD, 4K)
   - Whether "Elements" (character consistency) feature costs extra
   - Whether audio generation is included or costs extra
3. REAL cost-per-video calculation:
   - How many credits does a 5-second clip cost?
   - How many credits does a 10-second clip cost?
   - How many credits does a 21-second clip cost?
   - How many credits does a 60-second clip cost?
   - At each tier, how many finished videos can you actually produce per month?
4. What do REAL USERS report as their actual monthly spend?
   - Search Reddit (r/KlingAI, r/AIVideo, r/aivideo), YouTube creator reviews, and production blogs
   - What's the typical cost for someone producing 20-30 short-form videos per month?
5. Are there any hidden costs? (rendering queue priority, HD upscaling, re-generation when results are poor)
6. How many TAKES does it typically require to get a usable video?
   - What's the success rate per generation? (1 in 2? 1 in 5? 1 in 10?)
   - Do different styles have different success rates?
   - Specifically for stylized 3D / claymation-style content vs photorealistic
