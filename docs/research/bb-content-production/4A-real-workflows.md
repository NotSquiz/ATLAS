# Prompt 4A: Real AI Video Production Workflows (2026)

Research ACTUAL production workflows being used by creators making AI-generated short-form video content in early 2026. I need REAL methodologies, not theoretical pipelines.

1. Find 5-10 creators/studios currently producing AI-generated animated content for social media:
   - What tools do they use? (exact tool stack)
   - What's their actual workflow? (step by step)
   - How long does it actually take them per video?
   - What's their actual monthly output?
   - What's their actual monthly tool spend?
   - What's their success rate per generation (how many takes)?
2. Specifically for MidJourney + Kling pipeline (or similar image-to-video):
   - Real-world reports of how many Kling generations it takes to get a usable result
   - Does character consistency actually hold across multiple clips?
   - How do people handle the "stitching" of multiple short clips into one video?
   - What editing software do they use for assembly?
3. For creators producing 20-30+ videos per month:
   - How do they batch their workflow?
   - What's the actual time investment per month?
   - Do they use any automation tools? Which ones?
   - What's their actual per-video production cost?
4. CapCut vs other assembly tools:
   - Is CapCut still the best free option for short-form video assembly?
   - Are there better alternatives in 2026?
   - What about Creatomate or similar API-driven assembly for batch production?
5. Character consistency in practice:
   - How do real users maintain character consistency across 20+ video clips?
   - Does the --cref approach in MidJourney actually work reliably for video-to-video?
   - What workarounds have people developed?
   - Is there a better approach than MJ+Kling for character-consistent animated content?

Search YouTube ("AI video workflow 2026", "Kling workflow", "MidJourney video production"), Reddit (r/AIVideo, r/KlingAI, r/midjourney, r/VideoEditing), and production blogs.

Provide specific URLs, creator names/channels, and dates for all sources.
