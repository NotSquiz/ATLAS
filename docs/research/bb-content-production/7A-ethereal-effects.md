# Prompt 7A: Achieving Bioluminescent/Ethereal Effects in AI-Generated 3D

Research how to achieve bioluminescent, ethereal, and "glowing from within" effects using current AI image and video generation tools (MidJourney, Kling, Runway, etc.) as of February 2026:

1. MidJourney V7 specific:
   - What prompt techniques produce the best subsurface scattering / inner glow effects?
   - Find real examples and exact prompts from the MidJourney community
   - Can you achieve a "translucent clay lit from within" look?
   - What --stylize values, --chaos values, and style parameters work best for this?
   - Does V7 handle this differently from V6?
2. For animation:
   - Can Kling (or other tools) preserve the SSS/glow effect during animation?
   - Does the glow "flicker" or degrade during motion?
   - Find examples of animated glowing/bioluminescent content made with AI tools
3. Reference art direction:
   - Find examples of existing stylized 3D content that combines:
     - Warm clay/organic character design
     - Internal luminescence / subsurface glow
     - Dark cosmic or deep-sea backgrounds
     - The specific "foxfire" (bioluminescent wood) aesthetic
   - Both AI-generated and traditionally rendered examples
4. Practical prompt engineering:
   - Compile a list of exact MidJourney keywords/phrases that produce:
     - Translucent clay materials
     - Subsurface scattering effects
     - Bioluminescent glow
     - Cosmic/nebula backgrounds with warm characters
     - The transition from "glowing translucent" (unconscious) to "structured wood" (conscious)
   - What negative prompts are needed to prevent the glow from looking like plastic/neon/cheap?

Provide image examples (URLs) and exact prompts where available.
