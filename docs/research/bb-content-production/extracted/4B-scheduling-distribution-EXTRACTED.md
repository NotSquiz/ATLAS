## CROSS-POSTING

### Same Video to All Platforms
- **Viable?** Technically YES -- all four platforms accept the same core format (9:16, 1080x1920, MP4, H.264). Practically COMPLICATED -- each platform detects and penalizes competitor watermarks.
- **Evidence:** Article states "technically possible, algorithmically complicated."
- **Confidence:** VERIFIED (technical compatibility). CLAIMED (penalty specifics vary by source).

### Algorithm Penalties for Cross-Posting (2025-2026 data)

#### Instagram (Strictest)
- Adam Mosseri confirmed (2025): Reels with visible TikTok or CapCut watermarks receive reduced distribution and will NOT be recommended to non-followers. (CLAIMED -- attributed to Mosseri directly)
- Instagram algorithm detects when two accounts post the same video; promotes only the original. (CLAIMED -- attributed to Stack Influence research, Oct 2025)
- Duplicate content penalties can last 24 hours to 30 days. (CLAIMED -- Stack Influence, Oct 2025)

#### TikTok
- January 2025: Cross-posted content from other platforms penalized by up to 40% in reach. (CLAIMED -- Napolify analysis, June-July 2025)

#### Facebook
- July 2025: Algorithm updates demoting "unoriginal content" with watermarks. Aligned with Instagram's approach. (CLAIMED -- Social Media Today, Dec 2025)

#### YouTube Shorts
- Content with TikTok watermarks NOT eligible for Shorts Fund. (CLAIMED -- no specific source date cited for this claim)
- YouTube watermarks on other platforms: "Likely triggers detection" (speculative language in article).

### Per-Platform Modifications Needed
- **Captions:** Customize per platform (keyword style, length, tone).
- **Hashtags:** Different counts and strategies per platform (see Hashtag section).
- **Trending audio:** TikTok-specific; use "when relevant to Montessori/parenting."
- **Descriptions:** Instagram longer keyword caption; Facebook conversational under 125 chars; YouTube Shorts descriptive title under 60 chars.
- **Watermarks:** Remove ALL platform watermarks. Own branding/logo explicitly allowed (Mosseri confirmed).
- **SRT files:** Upload separately to YouTube Shorts only.
- **Stagger timing:** TikTok first, Instagram +2 hours, YouTube Shorts +4 hours, Facebook same day.
- **Confidence:** CLAIMED -- workflow recommended by article, not independently tested.

### Watermark Issues
- **TikTok watermark on other platforms:**
  - Instagram: CONFIRMED penalty (Mosseri statement). (CLAIMED -- attributed to Mosseri)
  - YouTube Shorts: Not eligible for Shorts Fund. (CLAIMED)
  - Facebook: Reduced distribution. (CLAIMED)
- **YouTube watermark on other platforms:** "Likely triggers detection" on Instagram and Facebook. (SPECULATIVE -- article uses hedged language)
- **Instagram watermark on other platforms:** "Likely triggers detection" on YouTube Shorts. Same Meta ecosystem so no issue on Facebook. (SPECULATIVE)
- **Own branding/logo:** Explicitly allowed on ALL platforms. Mosseri confirmed directly. (CLAIMED -- attributed to Mosseri)
- **Watermark removal tools mentioned:** SnapTik and SnapInsta (for TikTok), Kapwing (multiple formats).
- **Avoidance tip:** Download TikTok drafts BEFORE posting to avoid watermark entirely.

## POSTING FREQUENCY

### Minimum Per Platform for Algorithmic Relevance
| Platform | Minimum |
|----------|---------|
| TikTok | 3/week |
| Instagram Reels | 2/week |
| YouTube Shorts | 2-3/week |
| Facebook | 2-3/week |

### Maximum Useful Frequency (Diminishing Returns)
| Platform | Diminishing Returns Beyond |
|----------|---------------------------|
| TikTok | 4/day |
| Instagram Reels | 5/day |
| YouTube Shorts | 2-3/day |
| Facebook | 5/week |

### Recommended Frequency
- 5-7 videos/week is "perfectly in the sweet spot" for all platforms.
- Buffer Oct 2025 study (11.4M TikTok posts): Increasing from 1 to 2-5 posts/week yields **17% more views per post**. Biggest efficiency gains in that 2-5 weekly range, NOT from posting multiple times daily. (CLAIMED -- Buffer study)

### Critical Insight on Freshness
- All platforms prioritize **same-day content**.
- Instagram surfaces 50% more Reels published that day. (CLAIMED -- no specific source cited for this exact stat)
- YouTube algorithm gives content a 3x boost in the first 48 hours. (CLAIMED -- no specific source cited)
- Posting fresh content consistently matters more than posting frequently. (CLAIMED)

## CAPTIONS & HASHTAGS (2026)

### Hashtag Relevance Per Platform

| Platform | Max Hashtags | Optimal Number | Current Importance |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| TikTok | 5 (since Aug 2025) | 3-5 | Moderate -- keywords matter more |
| Instagram | 5 (since Dec 2025) | 3-5 | Low -- keywords critical |
| YouTube Shorts | 15 | 3-5 (always include #Shorts) | Moderate |
| Facebook | No strict limit | 1-3 | Low -- more = spam signals |

- **TikTok hashtag limit:** 5 per post, announced August 2025. Major shift from 30+ strategies of prior years. (CLAIMED -- TikTok official announcement, Aug 2025)
- **Instagram hashtag limit:** 5 per post, December 2025. Instagram also removed ability to follow hashtags in December 2024. (CLAIMED -- Sked Social, Dec 2025; ALM Corp, Dec 2025)
- **Adam Mosseri statement:** Hashtags "don't work" to increase reach. Algorithm now scans captions, bio, alt text, and on-screen text for keywords instead. (CLAIMED -- attributed to Mosseri)

### SEO Keywords in Descriptions
- **TikTok:** Front-load keywords in captions. Include searchable phrases naturally ("toddler tantrum tips," "Montessori at home"). TikTok functions as a search engine for parenting content. Algorithm reads captions, on-screen text, and transcribes spoken words for SEO indexing. (CLAIMED)
- **Instagram:** Keywords in captions more important than hashtags. First 125 characters visible before truncation. (CLAIMED)
- **YouTube Shorts:** Keyword-rich titles (55-60 characters max). First 125 characters of description matter. Always include #Shorts. (CLAIMED)
- **Facebook:** Keep descriptions under 125 characters with clear value proposition. (CLAIMED)

### Montessori-Specific Keyword Advice
- Prioritize terms parents actually search: "toddler independence," "practical life activities," "Montessori at home," "gentle discipline."
- Avoid insider terminology that parents won't search for.
- **Confidence:** CLAIMED -- editorial recommendation, not data-backed.

### Auto-Captions vs Burn-In vs SRT

| Platform | SRT Sidecar Support | Auto-Captions | Best Practice |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| TikTok | NO | Yes (75-85% accuracy) | Burned-in REQUIRED |
| Instagram | NO | Yes (must enable per video) | Burned-in REQUIRED |
| YouTube Shorts | YES | Yes (75-85% accuracy) | BOTH: burned-in + SRT for SEO |
| Facebook | Limited | Yes (available) | Burned-in PREFERRED |

- **Key stat:** 92% of U.S. consumers watch mobile videos with sound off. (CLAIMED -- no specific study cited by name)
- **Key stat:** Captioned videos receive 40% higher watch time. (CLAIMED -- no specific study cited by name)
- **Watch time** is the #1 algorithm ranking factor across all four platforms. (CLAIMED)
- Neither TikTok nor Instagram support SRT sidecar files. Burned-in is the only reliable option.
- YouTube Shorts uniquely benefits from hybrid approach: SRT for SEO indexing + auto-translation, plus burned-in for visual consistency when shared externally.

### Technical Specifications for Captions
- **Font:** Sans-serif (Arial, Montserrat, Helvetica) -- faster to read.
- **Size:** Minimum 48px for 1080x1920 vertical video.
- **Contrast:** White text on semi-transparent dark background.
- **Length:** 3-7 words per caption block, displayed 1-3 seconds each.
- **Position:** Center of screen, avoiding top 14% and bottom 20-35% (platform UI zone).
- **Animation:** Word-by-word highlighting increases engagement.
- **Tools:** CapCut (free tier works well), Descript, OpusClip.
- **Accuracy warning:** Auto-generated captions hit 75-85% accuracy -- always review for "Montessori" and educational terminology.

## RECOMMENDED TOOL

**Metricool (free tier)** is the article's primary recommendation.

### Why:
1. 50 posts/month handles 5-7 weekly videos across 4 platforms with margin (~20-28 posts/month needed, 50 available).
2. Direct publishing to all four platforms (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Facebook).
3. Competitor analytics included on free tier.
4. AI assistant included on free tier.
5. Cheapest paid upgrade ($18/month) if needed, versus Buffer at $5/channel/month (= $20/month for 4 channels).

### Runner-up: Buffer
- Simplest interface.
- Free tier works but is tighter (3 channels, 10 posts each, 8 lifetime channel connections).
- $5/channel/month paid tier is more expensive for 4+ channels than Metricool's $18/month.

### Not Recommended:
- Later ($18.75/month, no free tier).
- Hootsuite ($99/month, enterprise).
- Sprout Social ($199/seat/month, enterprise).

## CONTRADICTIONS & UNCERTAINTIES

### 1. Repurpose.io / YouTube Partnership vs. Cross-Post Penalties
- The article states YouTube partnered with Repurpose.io (Feb 2025) specifically to help cross-post TikTok/Reels content to Shorts, suggesting YouTube WANTS cross-posted content. Yet TikTok-watermarked content is "not eligible for Shorts Fund." These are not contradictory (watermark vs. clean file cross-posting) but could confuse readers. **Resolution:** YouTube wants the content, not the watermark.

### 2. Instagram Same-Day Boost Stat (50%) -- No Source
- "Instagram surfaces 50% more Reels published that day" is stated without a specific attribution. No study, date, or methodology cited. **Confidence: LOW.**

### 3. YouTube 3x First-48-Hour Boost -- No Source
- "YouTube's algorithm gives content a 3x boost in the first 48 hours" is stated without specific attribution. **Confidence: LOW.**

### 4. 92% Sound-Off Stat -- No Named Study
- "92% of U.S. consumers watch mobile videos with sound off" is a widely circulated figure but no specific study is named. Variants of this stat (80%, 85%, 92%) appear in marketing content since 2019. **Confidence: UNCERTAIN -- plausible but unverifiable from this source.**

### 5. 40% Caption Watch Time Increase -- No Named Study
- Same issue as above. Widely cited but no primary source given. **Confidence: UNCERTAIN.**

### 6. TikTok as "Search Engine" Claim
- Article states "TikTok increasingly functions as a search engine -- especially for parenting content." This aligns with widely reported 2023-2025 trends (Google's own internal research acknowledged TikTok/Instagram eating into search), but no 2026-specific data is provided. **Confidence: CLAIMED -- directionally supported by external evidence.**

### 7. Facebook Hashtag Guidance vs. Other Platforms
- Article says Facebook has "no strict limit" on hashtags but recommends 1-3 with "more = spam signals." This is editorial judgment, not a confirmed algorithm rule. **Confidence: CLAIMED -- reasonable but unverified.**

### 8. Buffer 8-Lifetime Channel Limit
- This is a notable and unusual limitation. If accurate, it means reconnecting the same platform account counts against the cap. No independent verification provided. **Confidence: CLAIMED -- unusual enough to warrant independent checking.**

### 9. Adam Mosseri Statements
- Multiple claims attributed to Mosseri (watermark penalties, hashtags "don't work," own branding allowed). No direct links, dates, or post IDs provided. Mosseri is known for making such statements publicly on Instagram, but without citations these are **CLAIMED -- plausible but unlinked.**

### 10. Staggering Post Order
- "TikTok first, Instagram +2 hours, YouTube Shorts +4 hours, Facebook same day" is presented as the correct workflow. No data or A/B testing is cited to support this specific ordering or timing gap. **Confidence: CLAIMED -- editorial recommendation only.**
