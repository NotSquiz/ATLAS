### Algorithm Signals (current)

Source: Adam Mosseri January 2025 statements, confirmed by Dataslayer.ai, Hootsuite, Sprout Social.

| Rank | Signal | Detail | Confidence |
|------|--------|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Watch time** | Most important signal. Whether viewers watch past first 3 seconds is key metric. | VERIFIED -- Mosseri January 2025 |
| 2 | **Sends per reach (DM shares)** | Strongest signal for reaching NEW audiences | VERIFIED -- Mosseri January 2025 |
| 3 | **Likes per reach** | Matters more for EXISTING followers | VERIFIED -- Mosseri January 2025 |
| 4 | **Saves** | Signals deep engagement; particularly strong for educational/utility content | VERIFIED -- Mosseri January 2025 |

**Critical correction:** The claim that "saves are the new top signal" is **INACCURATE for overall algorithm ranking**. Watch time and DM shares rank higher. Saves carry outsized importance specifically for educational content because tutorials/lists/tips inherently prompt saving behavior -- but saves are not the universal top signal.

Hootsuite 2026 guide quote: "Instagram is putting more weight on shares as a ranking signal... sending content via DM tells Instagram the content actually sparked a real connection, which is a stronger signal than simply tapping 'Save.'" [VERIFIED -- attributed to Hootsuite 2026]

### Optimal Length Data (2025-2026 studies)

| Source | Recommended Length | Notes | Confidence |
|--------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| OpusClip | 35-45 seconds | "Educational content can sustain slightly longer if payoff is clear" | CLAIMED -- no sample size |
| Lumen5 AI | 1-3 minutes | For "educational, in-depth, how-to content" | CLAIMED -- no sample size |

| Duration-agnostic ranking | Algorithm focuses on enjoyment, not length | VERIFIED -- Todd Sherman quote |
| Engaged Views for monetization | Actual watch duration determines revenue, not raw view count | VERIFIED |

### Hook Window

| Data Point | Value | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| Critical window | **2-3 seconds** | Hootsuite, OpusClip, VidIQ (convergence) | VERIFIED -- multiple independent sources |
| Drop-off in first 3 seconds | **50-60%** of all drop-offs occur within 3 seconds | OpusClip | CLAIMED -- single source |

| Music rule (critical) | Shorts **over 60 seconds using copyrighted music are BLOCKED from monetization** | VERIFIED -- only royalty-free or original audio permitted for 1-3 min Shorts |

### AI Content Eligibility (July 2025 policy)

Policy name change: "repetitious content" renamed to **"inauthentic content"** on July 15, 2025.

**AI-assisted content WITH original narration IS eligible if it includes:**
- Original human storytelling, narration, or editing
- Unique perspectives or commentary
- Meaningful creative input beyond template variation

**Demonetized content includes:**
- Fully automated videos with no human creative input
- Mass-produced content "only slightly different from video to video"
- AI voiceover reading other materials without original commentary
- Pure AI-generated scripts with AI voice and no human insight

**YouTube quote:** "Think of AI as your assistant, not the creator." [VERIFIED -- attributed to YouTube official policy]

**"Meaningful human creative contribution" definition:** Not explicitly defined with bright-line criteria. The policy provides examples rather than a formula. Key test: does the creator add original storytelling, narration, editing, unique perspectives, or commentary? Template variation alone does not qualify. [CLAIMED -- interpretation of policy language]

### Educational Content Specifically

- Sweet spot: **35-60 seconds** (multiple source convergence) [VERIFIED -- convergence]
- Bimodal finding: **13 seconds** (quick tips) and **60 seconds** (deeper content) both work well (VidIQ 2026) [CLAIMED -- single source]
- YouTube Shorts offers **superior long-term discoverability through search** vs Instagram/Facebook [CLAIMED -- editorial assessment, plausible but not quantified]

### Long Shorts Trend (evidence)

| Data Point | Evidence | Confidence |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Max length extended to 3 minutes | October 2024 | VERIFIED |
| Algorithm is duration-agnostic | Todd Sherman statement | VERIFIED |
| Completion rate drops sharply for 60-180s Shorts | 25-40% expected | CLAIMED |
| Retention plays larger role in RPM than raw views | 2025-2026 data | CLAIMED -- no specific study cited |
| Lumen5 recommends 1-3 minutes for educational | Single source recommendation | CLAIMED |

**Assessment:** The trend toward longer Shorts exists but is weaker than TikTok's equivalent. YouTube's higher completion rate expectations mean 60+ second Shorts are harder to execute profitably.

## FACEBOOK VIDEO

### Platform Recommendations (official)

| Data Point | Value | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| All videos now Reels by default | Announced June 17, 2025 -- eliminates video post vs Reels distinction | VERIFIED -- Meta official (about.fb.com) |
| Length/format restrictions | None (no stated limits) | VERIFIED |
| Content Monetization Program | Unified all monetization, October 2024 | VERIFIED |
| Global CMP expansion | August 31, 2025 | VERIFIED |

### Optimal Length Data

| Source | Finding | Confidence |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Socialinsider 2025** | **60-90 seconds** delivers peak engagement and views for Facebook Reels | VERIFIED -- same study as Instagram (31M posts) |
| Socialinsider 2025 | "Longer Reels work great for educational or informational content" | VERIFIED |
| Socialinsider 2025 | Older-skewing user base responds to "videos that tap into memory, strong viewpoints, or mini-drama" rather than trend-based content | CLAIMED -- editorial interpretation |

### Sound-Off Viewing (verify 85% claim)

**VERDICT: The 85% figure is OUTDATED and from a SECONDARY source, NOT official Meta data.**

| Data Point | Value | Source | Date | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|------------|
| **Original 85% claim** | 85% watch without sound | **May 2016 Digiday article** citing publisher reports from LittleThings, Mic, PopSugar | 2016 | **OUTDATED** -- publisher estimates, NOT official Facebook data |
| Facebook official confirmation | **Never publicly confirmed** this statistic | N/A | N/A | VERIFIED (absence) |
| Sound-on/off data in creator analytics | **Not available** | Facebook does not surface this | N/A | VERIFIED (absence) |
| Verizon Media/Publicis Media estimate | **69%** watch with sound off on mobile | 2019 study | 2019 | CLAIMED -- third-party research |
| St4.ca survey | ~**74%** watch without sound | Recent (date unspecified) | Unknown | CLAIMED -- unclear methodology |
| Instapage testing | Only **12%** turn sound on | Date unspecified | Unknown | CLAIMED -- single test, unclear methodology |

**Conclusion from source:** The exact percentage is unverifiable, but designing for muted viewing remains essential.

**Supporting data for muted-first design:**
- Captions boost view time by **12%** (Facebook's own data) [VERIFIED -- attributed to Facebook]
- Captioned videos are **40% more likely to have extended watch time** (Cropink 2025 analysis) [CLAIMED -- single source]

### 35-50 Demographic Advantage (verify)

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY VALIDATED with nuances.**

**2025 Facebook demographic data (Statista + DataReportal):**

| Age Group | % of Facebook Users | Confidence |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| 25-34 | 24-31% (LARGEST single group) | VERIFIED -- Statista/DataReportal |
| 35-44 | 18-20% | VERIFIED |
| 18-24 | 18-23% | VERIFIED |
| 45-54 | ~11% | VERIFIED |
| 55-64 | ~11% | VERIFIED |

**Key qualifying data:**

| Data Point | Value | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|--------|------------|
| 25-34 is technically the largest single group | Yes -- NOT 35-50 | Statista/DataReportal 2025 | VERIFIED |
| Facebook over-indexes for 25-54 vs TikTok/Snapchat | Yes | Comparative analysis | VERIFIED |
| 75%+ of parents use Facebook daily | Yes | LineLeader 2025 | CLAIMED -- single source |
| "Facebook is still the go-to platform for many parents, especially those aged 30-50" | Quote | ParentMarketing.com | CLAIMED |
| Users aged 55-64 spend MOST time on Facebook | **45 minutes/day average** | Not attributed to specific source | CLAIMED |
| Users aged 18-24 spend LEAST time | **22 minutes/day average** | Not attributed to specific source | CLAIMED |

**Assessment:** The "35-50 demographic advantage" claim is directionally correct but imprecise. The largest single age group is 25-34, not 35-50. However, Facebook significantly over-indexes for parents aged 25-54 compared to TikTok/Snapchat. The parent usage stat (75%+ daily) is strong if the LineLeader source is reliable.

### Algorithm Priorities (Facebook 2025-2026)

| Rank | Signal | Notes | Confidence |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | **Watch time and completion rate** | | CLAIMED -- no official ranking |
| 2 | **Shares (especially private/DM shares)** | "Number one indicator of potential greater reach" | CLAIMED -- quote source unclear |
| 3 | **Saves** | Content worth revisiting | CLAIMED |
| 4 | **Meaningful engagement** | Comments over passive likes | CLAIMED |
| 5 | **Content originality** | Recycled/watermarked content penalized | VERIFIED -- consistent with Meta policy |

**Additional data:**
- Up to **50%** of Feed content now comes from accounts users don't follow (discovery opportunity) [CLAIMED -- no source cited]

### AI Restrictions (Facebook)

| Data Point | Value | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|------------|
| Meta July 2025 "AI slop" crackdown | **500,000 accounts** sanctioned for spammy behavior | CLAIMED -- specific number but no official Meta source cited |
| Faceless AI + Wikipedia + stock footage | Now non-viable | CLAIMED -- editorial assessment |
| AI content with meaningful human enhancement | Permitted | VERIFIED -- consistent with Meta policy |
| Photorealistic AI content | Must be disclosed | VERIFIED -- Meta policy |

### Best Practices for Muted Viewing

Design philosophy: **"Sound off, delight with music on."**

1. Bold captions with high contrast
2. Keep text away from **bottom 35%** where interface overlays appear
3. Expressive visual action that communicates without audio
4. On-screen text explaining key points
5. Facebook auto-caption feature or burned-in subtitles

[CLAIMED -- editorial best practices, not empirically tested in source]

---

## CROSS-PLATFORM STRATEGY

### Same Video Across Platforms (viable?)

**No -- platform-specific optimization is recommended.**

A 45-second video can serve as a baseline, but optimal performance requires tailoring:
- Instagram + Facebook share same optimal range: **60-90 seconds**
- YouTube Shorts performs better shorter: **35-60 seconds** (higher completion rate expectations)
- TikTok (from 2A): **45-60 seconds** with trend-forward energy [CLAIMED -- editorial synthesis]

### Required Modifications Per Platform

| Platform | Modification | Confidence |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Instagram | Aesthetic presentation in captions | CLAIMED -- editorial |
| Facebook | Relatable/emotional framing, muted-first with burned-in captions | CLAIMED -- editorial |
| YouTube Shorts | Search-friendly titles, hooks that answer questions | CLAIMED -- editorial |
| Cross-posting from TikTok | **Remove TikTok watermarks** (reduces reach on Instagram) | VERIFIED -- well-documented cross-platform penalty |

### Minimum Length Variants Needed

**Two to three variants:**

| Variant | Length | Optimized For | Confidence |
|---------|--------|---------------|------------|
| Short version | **30-45 seconds** | YouTube Shorts; also works as teasers | CLAIMED -- editorial recommendation |
| Extended version | **60-90 seconds** | Instagram Reels + Facebook Reels | CLAIMED -- editorial recommendation |

**Production workflow:** Record at 60-90 seconds with clear segment breaks at 30-45 seconds. Export full version for Instagram/Facebook, shorter cut for YouTube Shorts.

### Watermark Issues

- TikTok watermarks reduce reach on Instagram [VERIFIED -- widely documented]
- Cross-posted watermarked content penalized for originality on Facebook [VERIFIED -- Meta policy]
- No specific data on YouTube Shorts watermark penalty cited [NOT ADDRESSED]

## KEY NUMBERS (Quick Reference)

| Platform | Optimal Length (Educational) | Hook Window | Key Algorithm Signal | Completion Rate Target |
|----------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Instagram Reels** | 60-90 seconds | 1.7-3 seconds | Watch time + DM shares | 60%+ |
| **YouTube Shorts** | 35-60 seconds | 2-3 seconds | Watch-through rate | 70%+ (<30s), 50%+ (30-60s) |
| **Facebook Reels** | 60-90 seconds | 3 seconds | Shares + completion | 50%+ |
| **TikTok (from 2A)** | 30-60 seconds (educational) | 3 seconds | Watch time (40-50% weight) + shares | 60%+ retention |

**Monetization-critical numbers:**
- YouTube Shorts: **45%** creator revenue share
- YouTube Shorts: Copyrighted music BLOCKS monetization on Shorts **over 60 seconds**
- YouTube Shorts: **10M views in 90 days** OR 4K watch hours for full YPP access
- Instagram: Reels Play Bonus **discontinued** August 31, 2025
- Instagram: AI-labeled content gets **23-47% lower** organic reach (CLAIMED -- single source)
- Facebook: Content Monetization Program expanded globally August 31, 2025

**AI content rules summary:**
- YouTube: AI-assisted with original narration = monetizable. Pure AI = demonetized. Policy renamed to "inauthentic content" July 15, 2025.
- Instagram: AI-generated must be labeled "AI info." Monetization available but reach may be penalized.
- Facebook: AI with human enhancement = OK. Photorealistic AI must be disclosed. 500K accounts sanctioned July 2025.

## CONTRADICTIONS & UNCERTAINTIES

### Internal Contradictions (within 2B)

1. **Socialinsider data used for both Instagram and Facebook** -- The "31 million posts" study is cited for both platforms. Unclear whether this is a single cross-platform study or separate analyses. If combined, platform-specific conclusions may be weaker than presented.

2. **"No minimum length for monetization" vs. music rule** -- While there is technically no minimum length, the practical minimum for copyrighted music use is effectively capped at 60 seconds. This is not a contradiction but could mislead if not read carefully.

3. **VidIQ bimodal finding (13s AND 60s)** -- This finding partly contradicts the "35-60 second sweet spot" convergence. If 13 seconds performs equally well, the optimal range is wider than the report suggests.

4. **Facebook algorithm ranking** -- The ranked list of Facebook algorithm signals is presented without clear sourcing. No official Meta ranking exists. The report may be synthesizing multiple sources into a confidence level that is not warranted.

### Contradictions with 2A (TikTok findings)

5. **Hook window consistency** -- 2B reports Instagram hook at 1.7-3 seconds, YouTube at 2-3 seconds, Facebook at 3 seconds. 2A reports TikTok at 3 seconds. The Instagram 1.7-second claim (from Dataslayer.ai citing unnamed "Instagram research") is the outlier. All other platforms converge on 2-3 seconds. The 1.7-second figure is LESS RELIABLE than the 3-second figure.

6. **Completion rate targets diverge** -- 2B gives YouTube Shorts 70%+ (under 30s) and 50%+ (30-60s). 2A gives TikTok 81.2% (under 10s), 41.8% (31-60s), 75%+ threshold for algorithmic boost. The TikTok data (TTS Vibes 2026, Buffer 1.1M videos) has stronger sourcing than the YouTube data (no specific sources named for completion rate expectations).

7. **Optimal educational content length varies significantly:**
   - TikTok (2A): 30-60 seconds
   - Instagram (2B): 60-90 seconds
   - YouTube Shorts (2B): 35-60 seconds
   - Facebook (2B): 60-90 seconds
   This supports the "minimum two variants" recommendation but the spread is wider than the cross-platform summary suggests.

8. **Algorithm signal ranking similarity** -- Both TikTok (2A) and Instagram/Facebook (2B) place watch time at #1 and shares at a high position. Saves are secondary on both. This is consistent, not contradictory, but worth noting: the "saves are most important" myth is debunked across ALL platforms examined.

9. **TikTok cross-platform note in 2A** claims "30-60 second sweet spot aligns well with Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts." But 2B shows Instagram optimal is 60-90 seconds (not 30-60) and YouTube Shorts is 35-60 seconds. The 2A cross-platform note is **PARTIALLY INACCURATE** -- the ranges overlap but do not align as neatly as claimed.

### Uncertainties / Unverifiable Claims

10. **Socialinsider 31M posts** -- Sample size is impressive but methodology, date range, geographic distribution, and content type breakdown are not provided. The same study is heavily relied upon for Instagram, Facebook, and educational content conclusions.

11. **Facebook sound-off percentages** -- Every estimate (85%, 69%, 74%, 12% turn on) comes from different sources using different methodologies at different times. No current, reliable figure exists. The directional conclusion (design for muted) is sound but the specific numbers should not be cited.

12. **Instagram AI reach penalty (23-47%)** -- From a single source (Virvid.ai) with a very wide range (24 percentage points). This suggests high uncertainty in the measurement. Could be noise, could be real. Treat as directional only.

13. **YouTube Shorts completion rate expectations** -- Presented as authoritative tiers (70-90%, 50-70%, 25-40%) but no specific study or YouTube official source is cited for these thresholds.

14. **Facebook 50% non-follower content claim** -- No source cited. Could be accurate (Meta has discussed this direction) but is unverified as stated.

15. **Facebook 500K accounts sanctioned** -- Specific number claimed but no official Meta source or press release cited. May come from third-party reporting.

16. **Time spent by age on Facebook (45 min/day for 55-64, 22 min/day for 18-24)** -- No source attributed. These are very specific numbers without sourcing.
