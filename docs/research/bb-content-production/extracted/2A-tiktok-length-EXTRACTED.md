## OPTIMAL LENGTH BY CONTENT TYPE

### Educational / Informational
- Over 60 seconds: **43.2% more reach**, **63.8% more watch time** (Napolify 2025)
- Engagement rate: **9.5%** (Dataslayer 2025) -- highest of any category
- Two-thirds of users report learning from creator content
- Educational content can tease learning outcome in 0-3 seconds with payoff by second 10
- Recommended: 60-90 seconds for deep dives; 30-45 seconds for quick tips
- Confidence: **VERIFIED** for the specific numbers; **CLAIMED** for the two-thirds statistic

### Parenting / Family
- Successful pattern: **two-tier strategy**
  - 30-60 second educational core content
  - 15-30 second "hook" versions for viral potential
  - 60-90 second demonstrations for Montessori activities / real scenarios
- Best hooks: State problem immediately ("When your toddler won't stop hitting...") or show end result first ("This one phrase stopped tantrums in our house")
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- derived from account analysis below, not a formal study

### Faceless / Animated
- "True faceless parenting accounts remain rare because trust-building often requires showing authentic interactions"
- Opportunities identified:
  - AI-animated parenting tips
  - Consistent character-based education
  - Privacy-preserving content (no real children shown)
- No specific length data for this subcategory
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- qualitative observation, no quantitative data

### General Entertainment (for comparison)
- Shorter videos (under 15 seconds) achieve highest completion rates

## ALGORITHM SIGNALS (Current 2026)

### Ranking Factors (approximate priority order)
1. **Watch time / Average watch time** -- estimated 40-50% weight
2. **Completion rate** -- 75%+ threshold for algorithmic boost
3. **Rewatch rate / Loops** -- videos with high replays "often explode days after posting"
4. **Shares** -- weighted significantly higher than likes
5. **Saves** -- increasingly important
6. **Comments** -- quality over quantity; 50-word comments outweigh emoji reactions
7. **First-hour engagement velocity**
8. **Search compatibility / TikTok SEO** -- 40% of Gen Z use TikTok for search
9. **Original audio** -- reportedly 3x more weight than trending sounds (January 2025 update)

### Completion Rate Weighting
- 75%+ completion rate is the threshold for algorithmic boost
- Algorithm evaluates BOTH percentage retention AND absolute watch time
- A 45-second video with 30 seconds watched typically outperforms a 20-second video with 16 seconds watched (despite lower percentage completion)
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- the 75% threshold and the 40-50% weight estimate have no specific source attributed

### Looping Behavior Impact
- Rewatches are "highly prioritized"
- TikTok interprets replays as "exceptional content quality"
- Effective looping strategies: seamless end-to-beginning transitions, text requiring multiple viewings, countdown sequences
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- attributed to "multiple sources" without naming them

### Longer Content Push (Evidence FOR)
- December 2024 algorithm update: engagement quality threshold moved from **3-5 seconds to 15-20 seconds**
- TikTok evaluates whether viewers remain engaged longer before deciding to boost
- Videos 60+ seconds: **432.5 median reach** vs 221 for 10-30 second videos (Buffer)
- **5 billion global views** on 1+ minute content (TikTok Newsroom)
- Users spend **50% of time** on 60+ second videos (TikTok Newsroom)
- Creator Rewards requires 1+ minute minimum
- Confidence: **VERIFIED** for Buffer data; **VERIFIED** for TikTok Newsroom claims (though no URL)

### Longer Content Push (Evidence AGAINST)
- Completion rates drop dramatically: 81.2% (under 10s) vs 41.8% (31-60s) vs 22.7% (90s+)
- Algorithm still uses completion rate as a quality signal
- Confidence: **VERIFIED** -- TTS Vibes 2026 data

### Hook Window
- **3 seconds** -- consistent across all sources
- 33% scroll past before 3 seconds (Sotrender 2025)
- 63% of highest-CTR videos deliver main message within 3 seconds
- December 2024 update means quality engagement through **15-20 seconds** now matters more
- Confidence: **VERIFIED** for 3-second window; multiple sources agree

### Likes Devaluation
- Likes are now considered "shallow engagement"
- Carry less weight than in previous years
- Shares, saves, and rewatches prioritized as quality indicators
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- no specific source or date for this change

## AI CONTENT ON TIKTOK

### Current Policy (Effective September 13, 2025)
- TikTok distinguishes between **realistic** and **stylized** AI content
- AIGC definition includes content "portraying realistic human likenesses" OR content "created in a particular artistic style (e.g. painting, cartoons, and anime)"
- Only the **realistic** category triggers mandatory labeling
- Practical test: "Could this fool someone into thinking it's authentic?"
- Confidence: **VERIFIED** -- specific policy date given (September 13, 2025)

### Stylized Content Status
- Quote: "TikTok doesn't care about obviously cartoony AI edits, AI-generated captions, or background music from AI tools. These don't need labels because they're either invisible or obviously synthetic. They can't mislead viewers."
- Source: Attributed to "TikTok Support and industry analysis"
- Obviously illustrated/cartoon content: **labeling optional**
- Confidence: **VERIFIED** -- attributed to TikTok Support, but no direct URL

### Enforcement Statistics (H2 2025)
- **51,618** synthetic media videos removed
- **8,600** accounts permanently banned for AI violations
- **340% increase** in enforcement compared to 2024
- Detection rate: **~35-45%** automatic detection
- Detection rate: **90%** for content with invisible watermarks
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- numbers given without specific source attribution

### Creator Rewards Program Eligibility
- TikTok does **not** explicitly ban AI content from monetization
- Requires "original, high-quality content" with "significant human creative input"
- Pure AI-generated content without editing or creative direction: likely won't qualify
- AI-assisted content meeting originality standards: **can be monetized**
- External sponsorships: remain possible for properly disclosed AI content
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- interpretive guidance, no direct policy URL

### What Is Safe
- Obviously stylized/cartoon AI content (labeling optional)
- AI avatars disclosed in bio
- Educational AI demonstrations
- AI characters giving lifestyle tips (with disclosure)
- AI-generated art or animations

### What Is Prohibited
- Unlabeled realistic AI content
- AI depicting private citizens or minors under 18
- AI-generated political content
- Content that could mislead about matters of public importance

---

## HOOK TIMING DATA

### Universal Window: 3 Seconds
- **33%** of viewers scroll past within first 3 seconds (Sotrender 2025)
- **45%** of viewers who watch 3 seconds will continue for at least 30 more seconds (source not attributed)
- **63%** of highest-CTR videos deliver main message within 3 seconds (source not attributed)
- Strong hook maintains **80-90%** of viewers through first 3 seconds (OpusClip)
- Good 3-second retention benchmark: **70-80%+** (Shortimize 2025)

### By Content Type
- **Comedy/entertainment**: Immediate punchline proximity required (0-2 seconds)
- **Educational content**: Can tease learning outcome in 0-3 seconds, payoff by second 10
- **Parenting content**: State problem immediately OR show end result first
  - Example hooks: "When your toddler won't stop hitting..." / "This one phrase stopped tantrums in our house"

### Post-Hook Engagement (December 2024 Update)
- Engagement quality threshold moved from **3-5 seconds to 15-20 seconds**
- TikTok now evaluates longer engagement before boosting
- Confidence: **CLAIMED** -- "December 2024 algorithm update" mentioned but no source URL

### Retention Curve Guidelines
- Sharp drop in first 3 seconds = Hook failing
- Strong initial retention but drop at 8-10 seconds = Hook worked but content didn't deliver fast enough
- Consistent gradual decline = Normal, acceptable pattern
- Videos keeping viewers past **40-60% completion** = "far more likely to hit sustained FYP exposure" (WebFX 2026)

---

## THE LENGTH DEBATE: SHORT vs MEDIUM vs LONG

### Team Short (7-15 seconds)
**Evidence supporting ultra-short videos:**
- Completion rate under 10 seconds: **81.2%** (TTS Vibes 2026)
- Completion rate 11-15 seconds: **76.4%** (TTS Vibes 2026)
- Algorithm has a 75%+ completion rate threshold for boost -- short videos clear this easily
- Looping behavior is easier to trigger with short videos
- TikTok's roots are in short-form; user expectations still skew short
- **Median reach for under-10s: only 194** (Buffer) -- reach is LOW despite high completion

**Who says this:**
- TTS Vibes (2026) -- focus on completion metrics
- Legacy TikTok advice (pre-2024)
- General social media "conventional wisdom"

**Weakness of this position:** Buffer's 1.1M video analysis shows short videos have the LOWEST median reach. High completion rate alone does not translate to high distribution.

---

### Team Medium (15-60 seconds)
**Evidence supporting medium-length videos:**
- TikTok for Business recommends **21-34 seconds** for ads (official)
- 30-60 second range: **median reach 302** (Buffer) -- solid middle ground
- Completion rate at 31-60 seconds: **41.8%** (TTS Vibes) -- below 75% threshold but total watch time compensates
- All 6 successful parenting accounts cluster in **30-90 second** range
- Document's overall recommendation for Baby Brains: **30-60 seconds primary**
- The "reconciliation" argument: a 45-second video with 30 seconds watched outperforms a 20-second video with 16 seconds watched in the algorithm

**Who says this:**
- TikTok for Business (21-34 seconds, for ads specifically)
- Document's own synthesis / recommendation
- Real parenting account analysis (observational)
- The document explicitly calls 30-60 seconds the "most balanced performance" and "best balance for most creators"

**Weakness of this position:** Neither the highest reach nor the highest completion rate. The "balance" argument is an interpretation, not directly measured.

---

### Team Long (60+ seconds)
**Evidence supporting longer videos:**
- Videos 60 seconds to 10 minutes: **median reach 432.5** (Buffer, 1.1M videos) -- HIGHEST reach
- Videos 3+ minutes: **more than 2x views** of 6-10 second videos (Buffer)
- **2-minute videos** achieved highest engagement AND highest views (Socialinsider, 2M videos)
- Educational content over 60 seconds: **43.2% more reach**, **63.8% more watch time** (Napolify)
- TikTok Newsroom: 1+ minute videos get **5 billion global views**; users spend **50% of time** on 60+ second content
- Creator Rewards requires **1+ minute minimum** for monetization
- December 2024 algorithm update extended quality evaluation window to **15-20 seconds** (favors longer content)
- Original audio gets **3x more weight** than trending sounds (January 2025) -- longer videos use more original audio

**Who says this:**
- Buffer (March 2025, 1.1M videos) -- strongest methodology
- Socialinsider (2M videos) -- second strongest methodology
- Napolify (2025) -- educational content specifically
- TikTok Newsroom -- platform's own data
- TikTok Creator Academy -- monetization rules

**Weakness of this position:** Completion rates crater: **~31%** for 60s-3min, **~23%** for 3+ minutes (TTS Vibes). The 75% completion threshold for algorithmic boost is unachievable at these lengths. This may mean longer videos get reach but from a DIFFERENT algorithmic pathway (total watch time rather than completion rate).

---

### Document's Resolution
The document resolves the debate with: "TikTok's algorithm evaluates both percentage retention AND absolute watch time. A 45-second video with 30 seconds watched typically outperforms a 20-second video with 16 seconds watched, even though the shorter video has higher percentage retention."

This is presented as fact but is **CLAIMED** -- no specific source or study is cited for this exact comparison. It is a reasonable inference from the data but not directly verified.

## CONTRADICTIONS & UNCERTAINTIES

### Contradiction 1: Reach vs Completion -- Fundamentally Opposing Signals
- **Buffer (1.1M videos)** says 60s-10min videos get **432.5 median reach** (highest)
- **TTS Vibes (2026)** says 60s-3min videos get only **~31% completion** (low)
- The document claims the algorithm weighs both, but the **75% completion threshold** (CLAIMED, unattributed) would make it impossible for 60+ second videos to receive a completion-based boost
- **Uncertainty**: How exactly does TikTok weigh total watch time vs completion rate? The document's "reconciliation" (45s video with 30s watched beats 20s with 16s watched) is presented as fact but is **unverified**

### Contradiction 2: TikTok's Own Guidance Is Internally Inconsistent
- **TikTok for Business**: 21-34 seconds optimal (for ads, 2021 data)
- **TikTok Creator Rewards**: 1+ minute minimum (for monetization)
- **TikTok Newsroom**: Promotes 60+ second content
- These serve different business goals (ad revenue vs creator retention vs platform stickiness) -- not a true contradiction but creates confusion

### Contradiction 3: Socialinsider vs Buffer on Peak Length
- **Socialinsider (2M videos)**: ~2 minutes is optimal for both engagement and views
- **Buffer (1.1M videos)**: 60s-10min range is optimal for reach (not specifically 2 minutes)
- These are compatible but use different metrics (engagement vs reach) and different granularity

### Contradiction 4: "The Old 7-15s Advice Is Outdated" -- But Is It?
- The document's opening line dismisses 7-15 second advice as "outdated"
- But TTS Vibes 2026 data shows 7-15 second videos still achieve **76-81% completion rates**
- Buffer shows low REACH for short videos -- but reach and virality are different metrics
- **Uncertainty**: For a NEW account with zero followers, does the algorithm favor high-completion short videos or high-watch-time long videos? No source addresses this directly.

### Contradiction 5: Approximate vs Exact Data
- Several data points in the completion rate table use tildes (~62%, ~31%, ~23%) suggesting they are interpolated or estimated, not directly from TTS Vibes
- The median reach figures are presented as exact but may be rounded
- **Uncertainty**: Were the approximate figures calculated by the research AI or reported by the sources?

### Uncertainty 1: No Parenting-Specific Algorithm Study
- No study specifically analyzed the TikTok algorithm's treatment of parenting/education content
- The parenting account analysis is observational (what lengths successful accounts use) not experimental (what lengths perform best)
- The 30-60 second recommendation for Baby Brains is an inference, not a finding

### Uncertainty 2: AI Content Detection and Treatment
- The document says stylized AI content is "safe" but provides no data on how AI content performs algorithmically
- Does TikTok's algorithm deprioritize detected AI content even if labeling isn't required?
- The enforcement stats (51,618 removals, 8,600 bans) are for violations -- no data on compliant AI content performance

### Uncertainty 3: Recency of Data
- TikTok for Business PDF (21-34 seconds): **2021 data** -- 5 years old
- Buffer analysis: March 2025 -- 11 months old
- Socialinsider: Up to June 2025 -- 8 months old
- TTS Vibes: 2026 -- most recent but no month specified
- Algorithm update: December 2024 -- 14 months old; may have been superseded
- **No source provides data from H2 2025 or 2026 specifically for reach metrics**

### Uncertainty 4: Cross-Platform Claim
- The document claims "30-60 second sweet spot aligns well with Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts"
- No data or source is provided for Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts optimal lengths
- This is a **CLAIMED** statement presented without evidence in this document

### Uncertainty 5: The "Significant Human Creative Input" Standard
- Creator Rewards eligibility requires "significant human creative input" for AI content
- What constitutes "significant" is not defined
- This is a policy interpretation, not a verified threshold
