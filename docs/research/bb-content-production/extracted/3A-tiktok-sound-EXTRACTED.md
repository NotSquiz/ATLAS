## TIKTOK SOUND MECHANICS

### Uploading with Own Audio
- TikTok automatically labels original audio as **"Original Sound - [your username]"** [CLAIMED -- attributed to TikTok Support, Jan 2026]
- There is **no option to prevent** other users from reusing your audio [CLAIMED -- same source]
- Any user can incorporate your sound into their own content [CLAIMED]
- If the sound gains traction, it drives discovery back to the original account [CLAIMED -- no data provided]

### Adding Trending Sound Over Own Video
- Original audio is **NOT replaced**; both tracks **layer together** simultaneously [CLAIMED -- attributed to Hollyland Creator Guide, Aug 2025]
- TikTok provides **two separate volume sliders** for original and added sounds [CLAIMED -- same source]
- Volume range for each slider: **0-200%** [CLAIMED]
- Recommended "low-volume trending sound" strategy: trending audio at **10-20% volume**, original voiceover at **100-200% volume** [CLAIMED -- no controlled study cited]

### Simultaneous VO + Trending Sound
- Yes, possible natively via dual volume sliders [CLAIMED]
- Platform allows only **one added sound per video** from its library [CLAIMED]
- For more sophisticated layering, creators must **pre-edit in external tools like CapCut** before uploading [CLAIMED]

### Silent Upload + Trending Sound
- Not directly addressed in the source document
- Implied: uploading without original audio and adding only a trending sound is mechanically possible, but no distribution impact data is provided for this specific scenario

### Key Statistic: Trending Sound Boost
- Videos using trending audio receive **98.31% more views on average** [CLAIMED -- attributed to Hootsuite 2025 analysis]
- Users are **3x more likely to complete videos** featuring familiar sounds [CLAIMED -- attributed to Hootsuite 2025 analysis]

## SOUND ON vs SOUND OFF DATA

### General Mobile Video (Non-TikTok)
- **75-85%** of general mobile video is watched on mute [CLAIMED -- attributed to TikTok/Kantar "Power of Sound" Research, 2021]

### TikTok-Specific Sound-On Rates
- **88%** of TikTok users describe sound as "essential" to their experience [CLAIMED -- attributed to TikTok/Kantar 2021, noted as "still widely cited"]
- **73%** say they would "stop and look" at content with audio [CLAIMED -- same source]
- Source date: **2021** (TikTok/Kantar report) -- noted as still widely cited but data is 5 years old at time of writing [UNCERTAINTY FLAG: aged data]

### Caption Usage
- **42%** of TikTok users prefer watching with captions enabled even when audio is available [CLAIMED -- attributed to Zebracat 2025 Statistics]
- Videos with closed captions see **17% more watch time** [CLAIMED -- same source]
- Effect particularly pronounced among users **25+** [CLAIMED -- same source]

### Impact on Educational Content Specifically
- Trending sounds boost engagement by approximately **47%** for educational content [CLAIMED -- attributed to TerminalFour Higher Education Report]
- Higher education case study: Pepperdine University trend-aligned campus video reached **78,000+ views** [CLAIMED -- same source]
- Critical caveat stated: trending audio will not rescue weak content; watch time and hooks remain primary drivers [CLAIMED]

## TRENDING SOUNDS FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT

### Does It Help? Evidence

- Higher ed trend-inspired content performs best "by a wide margin" [CLAIMED -- TerminalFour]
- Pepperdine campus video: **78,000+ views** using trend alignment [CLAIMED -- TerminalFour]

### Does It Feel Inauthentic? User Data
- No direct user sentiment data on inauthenticity provided
- The document recommends "selective" use -- implying over-reliance is considered a risk [INFERRED]
- Successful parenting accounts (Big Little Feelings, Solid Starts) **do use** trending sounds while maintaining authentic voice [CLAIMED]
- Science/education accounts (Kurzgesagt, MinuteEarth) **do not use** trending sounds, prioritizing brand consistency [CLAIMED]

### Case Studies

## VOICE/NARRATION

### AI Voiceover Detection & Penalties

#### Detection Systems
- TikTok implemented **mandatory labeling of AI-generated content** including audio in **late 2025** [CLAIMED -- attributed to Napolify, Nov 2025]
- Enforcement rates increased **340% year-over-year** [CLAIMED -- same source]
- **C2PA integration** now automatically detects content from **47 different AI platforms** [CLAIMED -- attributed to TikTok Advertising Policies, Nov 2025]
- TikTok removed **51,618 synthetic media videos** in latter half of 2025 [CLAIMED -- attributed to Napolify/Dataslayer]
- **8,600 accounts banned** for AI violations in same period [CLAIMED -- same source]

#### Evidence of Suppression
- Peer-reviewed 2025 study in *International Journal of Information Management*: **ads with AI-generated voice elicit lower consumer engagement compared to human voices** [VERIFIED -- peer-reviewed journal, ScienceDirect DOI provided]
- Lower-pitched AI voices **partially mitigate** the penalty, but engagement gap remains [VERIFIED -- same study]
- Creator reports: AI voiceover accounts experienced **38% lower For You Page exposure** following **November 2025** algorithm updates [CLAIMED -- attributed to Dataslayer, Dec 2025; "creator reports" = anecdotal]
- **November 2025**: TikTok introduced user-facing **AI content preference controls** -- users can opt to "see less" AI-generated content through Settings [CLAIMED -- attributed to Napolify, Nov 2025]
- This creates asymmetric risk: even non-suppressed AI content faces user self-selection reducing reach [CLAIMED -- analysis/inference in source]

#### Engagement Impact
- Human narration delivers **+21% higher completion rates** regardless of other factors [CLAIMED -- no specific source attributed for this statistic]

### Best Voice Style for Parenting Content

- Parenting content **strongly skews toward warm female voices** based on successful account analysis [CLAIMED]

#### Authoritative Male

- Kurzgesagt uses single professional narrator Steve Taylor [CLAIMED]
- Neither of these are parenting accounts [NOTED]

#### Other
- Key is matching voice to message: **energetic for hooks, conversational for explanatory content, empathetic for emotionally sensitive parenting topics** [CLAIMED -- editorial recommendation]

### Australian Accent
- **No controlled studies exist** measuring accent performance on TikTok [VERIFIED -- explicit statement of absence]
- TikTok's algorithm prioritizes **localization** -- content initially distributes to geographic region based on SIM card and IP address [CLAIMED -- attributed to Dash Social 2025]
- Australia has **8.5 million TikTok users** (38% of adults 18+) [CLAIMED -- attributed to Vidico 2025]

## CONTRADICTIONS & UNCERTAINTIES

### Contradiction 1: Trending Sound Access for Business Accounts
- The document states Business accounts **cannot access trending sounds** (music restrictions table)
- But the recommendation section suggests using "low-volume trending sound" strategy for Baby Brains
- The recommendation section also states "Baby Brains' competitive advantage is original animated content... Business account limitations are manageable"
- **Resolution unclear**: If BB uses a Business account, the trending sound strategy described throughout the document would be unavailable. The document does not explicitly reconcile this.

### Contradiction 2: Sound-On Statistics Age
- The 88% and 73% sound-on figures are from the **2021** TikTok/Kantar study
- The document was written in February 2026 -- 5 years later
- TikTok user demographics and behavior have shifted significantly since 2021
- The document notes these figures are "still widely cited" but does not provide updated data
- **Confidence: LOW** for current applicability of these specific percentages

### Uncertainty 1: +21% Completion Rate Claim
- The document states "Human narration delivers +21% higher completion rates regardless of other factors"
- **No specific source is attributed** for this statistic
- It appears in the AI voices section but is not linked to the IJIM study or any other named source
- **Confidence: UNVERIFIED**

### Uncertainty 2: 38% FYP Exposure Drop
- Attributed to "creator reports" via Dataslayer blog post
- This is **anecdotal/self-reported data**, not measured in a controlled study
- Creator perception of algorithmic changes is notoriously unreliable
- **Confidence: LOW**

### Uncertainty 3: 98.31% More Views Claim
- Attributed to Hootsuite 2025
- The extreme precision (98.31% rather than ~100%) suggests a specific study, but methodology is unknown
- Not clear if this controls for content quality, account size, posting time, etc.
- **Confidence: CLAIMED but methodology unknown**

### Uncertainty 4: 47% Educational Engagement Boost
- Attributed to TerminalFour Higher Education Report
- Based on higher education institutions, not parenting/baby content
- Transferability to parenting niche is assumed but not demonstrated
- **Confidence: CLAIMED for higher ed; UNCERTAIN for parenting niche**

### Uncertainty 5: MinuteEarth EUR 2.97M Funding
- No source attributed for this funding figure
- Not clear who provided this funding or for what period
- **Confidence: UNVERIFIED**

### Uncertainty 6: Australian Accent Impact
- The document explicitly states "no controlled studies exist"
- All claims about accent impact are inference and industry conventional wisdom
- **Confidence: ACKNOWLEDGED UNCERTAINTY in source**

### Gap 1: No Data on Silent Upload + Trending Sound
- The document does not address what happens to distribution when uploading a silent video with only a trending sound (no original audio)

### Gap 2: No Engagement Data for Listed Accounts
- None of the five case study accounts include engagement rate data (likes/views ratio, average views, etc.)
- Follower counts are provided but engagement metrics are absent

### Gap 3: No A/B Test Data
- No controlled experiments cited comparing same content with vs. without trending sounds
- All "boost" claims are correlational, not causal
