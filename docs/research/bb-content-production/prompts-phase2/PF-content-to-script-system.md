# Prompt PF: Content-to-Script System for Faceless Educational Content

## Context
I'm producing stylized 3D / clay-aesthetic short-form social content for "Baby Brains" -- a Montessori-inspired parenting education brand. Content is for PARENTS (adults), not children. I need a system to go from source material to a structured video script with scene breakdowns and generation prompts.

My content sources include:
- Montessori activity knowledge base (activities, age ranges, principles)
- Developmental science research
- Parenting philosophy guides
- The Baby Brains voice spec (warm, evidence-based, Australian, anti-sharenting)

Videos are produced in a multi-length strategy:
- Hook clips (7-15s): Algorithm testing, loop-optimized
- Core educational (30-45s): Primary parenting tips
- Deep dives (60-90s): Montessori demonstrations, monetization-eligible
- Long-form (90s-3min): Series/episodic

## Research Required

### 1. Faceless Content Script Systems
- Find REAL faceless / animated content creators who have shared their scripting process
- Search YouTube ("faceless content workflow", "AI content script system", "animated educational content creation"), Reddit (r/NewTubers, r/TikTokCreators, r/ContentCreation)
- How do successful faceless educational creators structure their scripts?
- What template systems do they use?
- How do they plan visual scenes when there's no face/person to show?
- What's the typical script-to-production ratio? (how many scripts do they write per finished video?)

### 2. Hook Structures for Parenting Educational Content
Research the CURRENT (2025-2026) most effective hook structures specifically for parenting/educational TikTok and Reels:
- The proven hook patterns from our research:
  - Problem statement: "When your toddler won't stop hitting..."
  - Result-first: "This one phrase stopped tantrums in our house"
- What OTHER hook structures work for this niche?
- Find 20-30 specific hook examples from successful parenting accounts
- How do hooks differ between 7-15s (loop hooks) vs 30-60s (educational hooks)?
- Should hooks be text-on-screen, voiceover-only, or visual-action-first?
- What hook-to-payoff timing works best? (immediate, 3-second, 10-second)

### 3. Scene Breakdown Methodology
- For animated/stylized content, how do creators break a script into visual scenes?
- What level of detail goes into each scene description?
  - Just the action? ("Baby picks up wooden ring")
  - Full visual spec? ("Close-up, Baby character reaches for red wooden ring on natural wood ring stacker, warm Montessori shelf background, soft overhead lighting, slight camera push-in")
- How many scenes typically make up a 30-second video? A 60-second video?
- Standard scene types for educational content:
  - Hook scene (0-3s)
  - Problem illustration
  - Solution demonstration
  - Tip/takeaway
  - CTA / brand moment
- Any standardized formats or templates for scene breakdowns?

### 4. Prompt Specification from Scene Descriptions
- How do production teams translate scene descriptions into AI generation prompts?
- Is there a standardized format that bridges "creative direction" and "AI prompt"?
- What information needs to be specified for each scene:
  - Character(s) present
  - Action / movement
  - Camera angle and movement
  - Lighting and mood
  - Environment / background
  - Props / objects
  - Duration
  - Transition to next scene
- Find examples of production documents / prompt sheets from AI video creators
- Any tools or templates for generating MidJourney/Kling/Pika prompts from creative briefs?

### 5. Content Calendar & Series Planning
- How do educational content creators plan content series (not just individual videos)?
- Series concepts for Montessori parenting:
  - "Activity of the Week" (recurring, same format)
  - "Age & Stage" (developmental milestones by month)
  - "Montessori Minute" (quick principle explanations)
  - "Environment Setup" (preparing spaces)
  - "Common Mistakes" (what NOT to do)
- How to plan a content calendar that mixes quick tips, deep dives, and series episodes
- Batch planning: do creators plan a month of content at once?
- How to maintain variety while keeping a consistent brand voice

### 6. Knowledge Base to Script Pipeline
- For a knowledge-base-driven content brand, how do you systematically turn knowledge entries into scripts?
- Input: A Montessori activity entry (e.g., "Object Permanence Box, 8-12 months, develops understanding that objects continue to exist when out of sight")
- Output: A complete video script with:
  - Hook (first 3 seconds)
  - Problem/context (why parents need this)
  - Demonstration (the activity in action)
  - Key learning point (what the child develops)
  - Practical tip (how to do this at home)
  - CTA (follow for more, share with a parent who needs this)
- Can this conversion be templated? What are the reusable structures?
- How do creators avoid repetitive content when working from a knowledge base?

### 7. A/B Testing Systems for Hooks and Formats
- How do short-form creators systematically test different hooks for the same content?
- Do they produce multiple versions of the same video with different hooks?
- How do they track which hooks, lengths, and formats perform best?
- Spreadsheet systems, analytics tools, or methodologies for A/B testing
- What sample size (views, videos) do you need before drawing conclusions?
- How do creators iterate on underperforming content?

### 8. Script Template Examples
- Find and document 3-5 actual script templates used by successful educational/parenting creators
- For each template:
  - The structure (sections, timing, beat sheet)
  - How visual directions are noted
  - How voiceover text is written
  - How music/sound cues are marked
  - How hooks and CTAs are formatted
- Adapt these for AI-animated content specifically
- What modifications are needed when the visual is AI-generated vs filmed?

Provide specific URLs, creator names, template examples, and dates for all sources. Focus on PRACTICAL, immediately usable templates and systems, not theoretical frameworks.
