# Prompt PB: Pika Stylized Clay Pipeline

## Context
I'm producing stylized 3D / clay-aesthetic short-form social content for a parenting education brand. Pika 2.5 was rated 5/5 for stylized content quality with 74-89% first-try success rate (highest in industry). I'm considering Pika Pro ($28/month, 2,300 credits) as my primary video tool for clips under 25 seconds, with MidJourney Standard ($30/month) for image generation.

My character design: ovoid/egg-shaped head, Brancusi-inspired, warm clay-amber tones with bioluminescent subsurface glow. Pixar-meets-solarpunk aesthetic.

## Research Required

### 1. Pika 2.5 End-to-End Workflow
- Find REAL creators using Pika for stylized 3D / clay / Pixar-style content production
- Search Reddit (r/PikaArt, r/AIVideo), YouTube ("Pika 2.5 workflow", "Pika clay animation"), production blogs
- What is their exact step-by-step workflow from concept to finished video?
- How do they handle the MidJourney (image) -> Pika (video) handoff specifically?
- What image resolution, format, and aspect ratio works best as Pika input?
- How do they structure their prompts for image-to-video?

### 2. Pikaffects for Clay Deformation
- Pika has "Pikaffects" features: Squish It, Melt It, Inflate It, Crush It, Explode It, Cake-ify, etc.
- Which Pikaffects are useful for creating authentic clay-like deformation and movement?
- Can Pikaffects be combined with standard animation prompts?
- Find video examples of Pikaffects used on 3D clay-style characters
- Are there any Pikaffects that specifically enhance the "handmade" tactile quality?

### 3. Pikaframes for Multi-Scene Videos
- Pikaframes allows keyframe-based animation for extended videos (up to 25 seconds)
- Exact credit cost per Pikaframes generation at different lengths and resolutions
- How does the keyframing work in practice? Do you upload start and end frame images?
- How well does Pikaframes maintain character consistency between keyframes?
- What's the success rate for Pikaframes vs standard generation?
- Find real user reports of using Pikaframes for 15-25 second clips

### 4. Prompt Engineering for Pika Clay Aesthetic
- What prompt structure produces the best clay/3D results in Pika specifically?
- Does Pika respond well to "claymation", "clay render", "Pixar style" etc.?
- What camera movement prompts work in Pika? (zoom, pan, dolly, orbit)
- How specific can you be about character action/movement?
- What negative prompts reduce artifacts in Pika?
- How does Pika handle subsurface scattering / bioluminescent glow effects?

### 5. Character Consistency in Pika
- Pika was rated 3/5 for character consistency (no dedicated reference-image system)
- How do experienced users maintain character consistency across multiple Pika clips?
- If I generate consistent character images in MidJourney (using --oref), does feeding those as input to Pika preserve the character well?
- Any workarounds for improving consistency? (consistent prompting, seed control, style references)
- Compare: is it better to generate all clips from the same MJ source image (different actions via prompt) or use different MJ images as input?

### 6. Credit Optimization on Pika Pro ($28/month, 2,300 credits)
- Exact credit costs for each generation type:
  - Text-to-Video at different lengths and resolutions
  - Image-to-Video at different lengths and resolutions
  - Pikaframes at different lengths
  - Pikaffects
- How many finished 10-15 second clips can I realistically produce with 2,300 credits?
- Accounting for re-rolls (even at 74-89% success rate, some clips need 2-3 tries)
- Is there a strategy to preview/test cheaply before committing credits to HD?
- Do credits expire if unused? (research says no rollover -- confirm)

### 7. Pika vs Kling vs Hailuo Quality Comparison for Clay Content
- Find head-to-head comparisons of Pika vs Kling vs Hailuo for stylized 3D content
- YouTube comparison videos, Reddit threads, blog posts
- Which tool produces the most "authentic clay" look?
- Which handles smooth, natural character movement best for the clay style?
- Which has the least artifacts (hand errors, face morphing, color shift)?

### 8. Assembly Workflow (Stitching Multiple Pika Clips)
- Since Pika generates 5-second clips (or 25s via Pikaframes), how do creators assemble longer videos?
- CapCut vs DaVinci Resolve vs Premiere for assembly -- what do Pika users prefer?
- Best practices for transition types between AI-generated clips
- How to match lighting and color between clips that were generated separately
- Audio sync: adding voiceover and music after clip assembly vs before
