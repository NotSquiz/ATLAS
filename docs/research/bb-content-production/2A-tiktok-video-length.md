# Prompt 2A: TikTok Optimal Video Length (2026 Data)

Research the CURRENT optimal video length for TikTok as of early 2026. I've seen conflicting information: some sources say 7-15 seconds, others say 15-25 seconds, others say up to 60 seconds. I need CURRENT, data-backed answers.

1. What does TikTok's own documentation/creator resources currently recommend?
2. What do the most recent (2025-2026) studies and analyses show?
   - Search for: TikTok algorithm studies 2025 2026, TikTok optimal length 2026, TikTok completion rate by length
   - Include data from: Later.com, Hootsuite, Sprout Social, Socialinsider, Buffer -- their most recent reports
3. Does optimal length vary by content type? Specifically for:
   - Educational/informational content (our category)
   - Parenting/family content niche
   - "Faceless" animated content
4. What are the SPECIFIC algorithm signals TikTok uses in 2026?
   - Completion rate weighting -- is it still the #1 factor?
   - Does looping behavior still boost distribution?
   - Has TikTok changed its algorithm to favor longer content (they've been pushing longer videos)?
   - What's the current "hook window" -- is it still 3 seconds or has it changed?
5. Real-world data from parenting/educational creators:
   - What video lengths are the top-performing parenting TikTok accounts posting?
   - Find 5-10 successful educational parenting accounts and analyze their typical video lengths
   - Are any of them using AI-generated/animated content? What lengths work for them?
6. TikTok's current stance on AI content:
   - Latest enforcement actions and policy updates
   - Is stylized AI content still in the "safe zone"?
   - Any changes to the Creator Rewards Program eligibility for AI content?
7. Hook timing: What's the CURRENT data on how quickly you need to hook viewers?
   - First 1 second? First 2? First 3?
   - Is this different for different content types?
