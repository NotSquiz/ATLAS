# Prompt 2B: Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts & Facebook Optimal Length (2026)

Research CURRENT optimal video lengths for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook video as of early 2026.

For EACH platform:
1. What does the platform's own creator documentation currently recommend?
2. Most recent (2025-2026) data on optimal length:
   - Find the most recent studies from Hootsuite, Later, Sprout Social, Buffer, Socialinsider, etc.
   - Separate data for educational/informational content from entertainment
3. Algorithm priorities (current, verified):
   - What signals does the algorithm prioritize? (watch time, completion rate, saves, shares, comments)
   - Has the weighting changed recently?
   - Is "saves" really the new top signal for Instagram? Verify with current data.
4. Hook window per platform -- how quickly must you grab attention?
5. Monetization requirements:
   - YouTube Shorts: What's the CURRENT minimum for monetization? Still 60 seconds?
   - Does YouTube still consider AI-assisted content with original narration as eligible?
   - Instagram: Any AI-specific monetization restrictions?
6. For YouTube Shorts specifically:
   - Has the algorithm shifted toward longer Shorts in 2026?
   - What's the completion rate expectation for 60s vs shorter?
   - Is there a "sweet spot" for educational content?
7. For Facebook specifically:
   - What percentage of users watch with sound off? (verify the 85% claim)
   - Best practices for muted-first viewing
   - Does Facebook still have the "35-50 demographic" advantage for parenting content?
8. Cross-platform strategy:
   - Can the same video length work across all platforms, or must you produce different lengths?
   - If different, what's the minimum number of length variants needed?

Provide all source URLs with dates. Be explicit about which data points are verified 2026 data vs older.
