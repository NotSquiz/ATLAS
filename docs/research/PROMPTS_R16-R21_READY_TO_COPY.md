## PROMPT R16: Contextual Appropriateness Detection

```
I'm building an AI mentor assistant that can offer philosophical/wisdom guidance, but it must NEVER be random, preachy, or tone-deaf. The AI needs to accurately detect when such guidance is appropriate.

Research the following for me (as of January 2026):

1. CONVERSATIONAL SIGNALS
- What linguistic markers indicate a user is receptive to deeper guidance vs wanting practical help only?
- How does conversation trajectory affect appropriateness?
- How to distinguish "venting" from "seeking advice"?

2. THE "READING THE ROOM" PROBLEM
- How do skilled mentors/therapists know when to offer perspective vs just listen?
- Research from coaching, therapy, and mentorship on timing of interventions
- The difference between invited wisdom and imposed wisdom

3. ANTI-PATTERNS
- When does philosophical input feel preachy or condescending?
- What makes "inspirational" content hollow?
- How to avoid pedantic "actually..." responses

4. IMPLEMENTATION
- Prompt engineering for context sensitivity
- Multi-turn conversation analysis techniques
- Confidence thresholds for offering guidance
- Explicit vs implicit permission detection

Provide specific detection heuristics, linguistic markers to look for, anti-patterns to avoid, and a practical framework for "permission to go deeper." Include academic sources and named researchers where possible.

## PROMPT R17: Coherent Wisdom Synthesis

```
I want to synthesize a coherent philosophical worldview for an AI mentor focused on masculine self-mastery. The foundation is Stoicism and Miyamoto Musashi's Dokkōdō (21 Precepts).

Research the following for me (as of January 2026):

1. COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS
- What do Stoicism and Bushido share at foundational level?
- Where might they conflict and how is it resolved?
- Other traditions compatible with these foundations (non-religious)

2. TRADITIONS TO CONSIDER
- Classical: Aristotelian virtue ethics, Roman exempla
- Eastern: Zen Buddhism (action focus), Hagakure, Sun Tzu
- Modern: Clear thinking, decision theory, antifragility
- Historical archetypes: Renaissance courtier, Victorian gentleman

3. THE "LETHAL GENTLEMAN" IN HISTORY
- Historical/literary figures who embody refined + dangerous
- The warrior-poet tradition
- "Dangerous but disciplined" as an ideal

4. UNIFIED THEMES
What principles bind these into coherence:
- Self-mastery, excellence, clear thinking
- Controlled power, restraint, purposeful action
- Acceptance of reality, constant improvement

5. WHAT TO EXCLUDE
- Traditions requiring religious belief
- Passive philosophies without action orientation
- Victimhood/blame narratives
- Pseudo-masculine posturing

Provide a curated set of 3-5 compatible traditions, their core principles, key texts, and how they complement each other for a "Lethal Gentleman" archetype. Be specific and practical.

## PROMPT R18: User State Modeling

```
I'm building an AI assistant that adjusts its persona, tone, and guidance style based on user state. Research the following for me (as of January 2026):

1. STATE DIMENSIONS TO TRACK
- Emotional (frustrated, calm, anxious, confident)
- Cognitive load (overwhelmed, focused, scattered)
- Energy level (depleted, energized)
- Openness (defensive, receptive, exploring)
- Goal clarity (knows what they want vs seeking direction)

2. DETECTION MECHANISMS
- Linguistic markers of emotional state
- Conversation dynamics (response speed, topic shifts)
- Explicit statements vs implicit signals
- Historical patterns (user's baseline vs deviation)
- Voice analysis (tone, pace) if available

3. STATE PERSISTENCE
- How long does detected state persist?
- How to update within a conversation?
- How to carry across sessions?
- When to reset assumptions?

4. MODE SELECTION MAPPING
When should AI be:
- Minimal/efficient (user in flow)
- Structured/supportive (user overwhelmed)
- Challenging (user needs push)
- Philosophical (user seeking meaning)
- Just listening (user venting)

5. RESEARCH SOURCES
- Affective computing literature
- Therapeutic conversation analysis
- Customer service AI research
- Coaching methodology

Provide a state model framework with dimensions, detection heuristics for each state, mode-to-state mapping, and uncertainty handling. Include named researchers and papers.

## PROMPT R19: Deep AI Persona Engineering

```
I'm creating an AI persona that needs to feel genuinely deep and consistent, not gimmicky or like a thin veneer. The persona is a "Lethal Gentleman" mentor figure.

Research the following for me (as of January 2026):

1. SHALLOW VS DEEP PERSONAS
- What makes AI personas feel shallow? (Inconsistency, catchphrases without substance, breaking under pressure)
- What makes them feel deep? (Consistent worldview, natural variation, character-appropriate reactions)

2. PERSONA AS OPERATING SYSTEM
- How to embed persona in reasoning process, not just output formatting
- Persona influencing WHAT to say, not just HOW
- Character-driven prioritization

3. THE UNCANNY VALLEY
- When does character feel performative?
- Natural vs forced personality markers
- Earning familiarity vs forced intimacy

4. RESEARCH AREAS
- Character writing from fiction (how novelists create voice)
- Role-based prompting research
- Consistent character in conversational AI
- User perception of AI personality

5. SPECIFIC TO "LETHAL GENTLEMAN"
- Vocabulary level (educated, not pretentious)
- Sentence structure and rhythm
- What this persona says vs never says
- How disagreement is expressed
- How praise is given

Provide a framework for persona depth, consistency mechanisms, anti-patterns that break immersion, and specific style guidelines. Include examples of good and bad persona implementation.

## PROMPT R20: AI Self-Improvement Architecture

```
I want to build an AI assistant that can monitor its own performance, track relevant research, and propose improvements to itself (with human approval). Research the following for me (as of January 2026):

1. PERFORMANCE SELF-ASSESSMENT
- What metrics indicate good/poor AI assistant performance?
- How to detect capability gaps from interactions?
- Failure mode detection (when did it fail to help?)
- User satisfaction signals (explicit and implicit)

2. RESEARCH MONITORING
- How to filter AI research firehose for relevance?
- Automated paper/announcement tracking systems
- Relevance and priority scoring methods
- Current best sources for AI advancement

3. SELF-IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS
- Structure for proposing changes to human operator
- Risk assessment for changes
- A/B testing methodology
- Rollback capability

4. META-COGNITION
- How can AI know what it doesn't know?
- Confidence calibration research
- Blind spot detection
- Proactive knowledge gap identification

5. TRUSTED SOURCES
- Anthropic research
- Academic labs (Stanford HAI, Berkeley BAIR, MIT CSAIL, CMU)
- Applied researchers (LangChain, Hugging Face community)
- Individual thought leaders
- arXiv filtering strategies

Provide a self-assessment framework, research monitoring architecture, proposal template, and trusted source curation criteria. Must work within constrained resources (6GB RAM system).

## PROMPT R21: The "Lethal Gentleman" Archetype

```
I'm defining a "Lethal Gentleman" archetype for an AI mentor persona. This is NOT just a butler, NOT just dangerous, but a synthesis of refinement and capability.

Research the following for me (as of January 2026):

1. ARCHETYPE DEFINITION
- What distinguishes "lethal gentleman" from just "gentleman"?
- What distinguishes it from just "dangerous"?
- Historical and literary examples (real and fictional)
- The warrior-poet tradition

2. CHARACTER TRAITS
- Competence and quiet confidence
- Restraint and controlled power
- Directness without brutality
- Warmth without softness
- Grace under pressure
- Standards and expectations

3. SPEECH PATTERNS
- Vocabulary (educated but accessible)
- Sentence structure (varied, sometimes aphoristic)
- What is said vs implied
- Silence and space in conversation
- How disagreement is expressed
- How praise is given (understated, meaningful)

4. BEHAVIORAL PRINCIPLES
- When to be gentle, when to be hard
- How to challenge without attacking
- Supporting without enabling
- Respecting autonomy while guiding
- When to push, when to step back

5. WORLDVIEW
- Excellence as standard
- Responsibility and agency
- Reality as it is, not as wished
- Forward focus (not dwelling)
- Honor as non-negotiable
- Self-improvement as practice

6. WHAT THIS PERSONA NEVER DOES
- Servile agreement
- Empty encouragement
- Performative toughness
- Unsolicited lecturing
- Emotional unavailability
- Arrogance or superiority

Provide a detailed character profile, speech pattern guidelines with examples, behavioral decision tree, worldview principles, and clear anti-patterns. Make it implementable in prompt engineering.
