# Vehicle Safety and Family Protection Research

## Overview

This document compiles mainstream driver education, police recommendations, and road safety authority guidance on vehicle safety for families. The focus is on practical, everyday safety practices from authoritative sources including Australian state transport departments, police services, and recognized road safety organizations.

**Key Principle:** The vehicle is one of the safest places you can be during a threat - it provides mobility, protection, and escape options. Most vehicle safety comes down to awareness, preparedness, and calm decision-making.

## 1. Everyday Vehicle Security

### Locking Habits and Awareness

**The Basics:**
- Always lock doors and close windows, regardless of trip length or neighborhood safety
- Lock doors immediately upon entering the vehicle
- Keep valuables out of sight - the glove box and centre console are the first places thieves look
- Store purchases in the trunk before arriving at your next destination, not after

**Key Insight:** According to [Allianz Australia](https://www.allianz.com.au/car-insurance/articles/how-to-prevent-car-theft.html), one in five cars are stolen via keyless entry hacks. If your vehicle has electronic push-start technology, consider installing an OBD port lock - they are inexpensive, easy to install, and readily available from auto shops.

### Parking Lot Safety Practices

Parking lots rank as the third most frequent location for violent crimes, with approximately 1,400 attacks occurring daily across the US. One in five car accidents also occurs in parking lots.

**Choosing a Parking Spot:**
- Select well-lit areas close to store entrances
- Avoid rear building areas with delivery truck activity
- Avoid secluded spots with limited visibility
- In evening hours, prioritize well-lit areas near main entrances
- Look for spots with clear sightlines and easy exit routes

**Approaching and Entering Your Vehicle:**
1. Have keys in hand before leaving the store
2. Walk briskly with head up and shoulders back - project confidence
3. Scan the area as you approach
4. Check the backseat before entering
5. Lock doors immediately once inside
6. Do not sit and scroll your phone - start the vehicle and leave

**For Families with Children - The S.T.A.R. Method:**
Teach children this acronym from [Connecting For Kids](https://www.safeintheseat.com/post/8-parking-lot-safety-tips-for-parents):
- **S - STOP:** As soon as you exit the car, stop and stand still
- **T - TOUCH:** Touch a designated safe spot (door handle, car magnet) and keep your hand there
- **A - ATTENTION:** Pay attention to cars around you, listen to your parent
- **R - READY:** Wait for the adult to say it is time to go, then take their hand

### Expert Prevention Tips

From [Victoria Police](https://www.police.vic.gov.au/rideshare-driver-safety-and-carjacking):
- Do not leave documents containing personal information in your car
- Install security cameras and motion-sensor lights around your home parking area
- Park in well-lit areas or secure garages whenever possible
- Store keyless entry fobs in a Faraday pouch at home to block relay attack signals
- Never leave spare keys in your glove box or under the car

## 2. Defensive Driving

### Core Principles

Defensive driving is about anticipating dangerous situations and staying proactive rather than reactive. According to the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.trustedchoice.com/insurance-articles/wheels-wings-motors/defensive-driving-tips/), approximately 94% of traffic accidents are caused by human error - emphasizing the importance of awareness, preparation, and control.

### Situational Awareness

**Avoid "Autopilot" Driving:**
Many drivers operate on autopilot, simply getting from point A to point B without attention to surroundings. Active awareness can prevent many accidents.

**Continuous Scanning:**
- Regularly check rearview and side mirrors
- Focus on the road ahead, not just the vehicle immediately in front
- Monitor vehicles behind and beside you
- Look for potential hazards early

### The Three-Second Rule and Escape Routes

**Following Distance:**
Maintain at least three seconds between your vehicle and the one ahead. This provides reaction time and maneuvering space.

**Maintaining Escape Routes:**
An escape route is a planned path you can use to avoid a collision or dangerous situation. From [Street Survival](https://streetsurvival.info/escape-routes/):

- Regularly check for alternate routes (shoulders, adjacent lanes)
- Avoid getting "boxed in" - surrounded by vehicles with no room to escape
- Leave "escape room" to your left and right when possible
- When stopping at lights, leave enough space to see the rear tires of the car ahead - this typically provides enough room to pull around if needed

### Weather Condition Adjustments

- Slow down and increase following distance
- Use low beams in fog (high beams reflect light, reducing visibility)
- Avoid sudden movements - accelerate and brake gradually to prevent skidding
- Add extra stopping distance on wet roads

### Avoiding Road Rage Situations

**Prevention Techniques:**
From [DefensiveDriving.org](https://www.defensivedriving.org/dmv-handbook/avoiding-road-rage-12-ways-you-can-escape-aggressive-driving/):
- Do not make rude gestures or yell at other drivers
- Avoid eye contact with aggressive drivers
- Do not tailgate, weave through traffic, or flash high beams
- Do not block the passing lane
- Use your horn sparingly - primarily for emergencies
- Signal an apology if you make a mistake (brief wave)

**If Confronted by an Aggressive Driver:**
1. Let them pass - they will typically move on quickly
2. Create distance by slowing down or changing lanes
3. Do not reciprocate aggressive behavior
4. If followed, drive to a police station, fire station, or busy public location
5. Do not drive home
6. Call 000 if you feel your safety is threatened

**Statistics:** According to [SafeMotorist](https://click2drive.com/tips-for-dealing-with-road-rage/), 12,610 injuries and 218 murders in the US over a seven-year span were attributed to road rage. 66% of traffic fatalities can be attributed to aggressive driving.

## 4. Carjacking Awareness

### Australian Statistics

From [Kingsford Lawyers](https://kingsfordlawyers.com.au/carjacking-in-australia/):

While carjacking remains relatively rare in Australia, frequency is increasing, particularly in Queensland and Victoria. These crimes are becoming increasingly violent and unpredictable.

**Key Statistics:**
- Queensland: 20,153 stolen vehicles in 2023 (up from 19,237 in 2022)
- Victoria: 22,504 car thefts in 2024 - up 41%, the highest since 2003
- National: 65,603 motor vehicle thefts in 2024 (8% increase from previous year)
- Insurance claims for car theft reached $223 million in the year to June 2025
- Offenders aged 15-24 account for over half of motor vehicle thefts in Victoria

**Common Methods:**
Modern thieves use sophisticated technology:
- Keyless entry hacks
- Signal boosters and relay attacks
- Push-start technology exploitation

### Prevention Through Awareness

**Vulnerable Moments:**
From [California Highway Patrol](https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/services-information/avoiding-vehicle-theft/are-you-vulnerable-to-a-carjacker/):
- At traffic lights and intersections
- Entering or exiting vehicles
- At petrol stations
- In parking structures
- When distracted (phone, children, packages)

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Keep doors locked and windows up at all times
- When stopping, leave enough room to maneuver around other cars
- Be aware of your surroundings at all times
- Avoid stopping in isolated or poorly lit areas when possible

**Bump and Rob Tactic:**
One common carjacking tactic involves intentionally hitting the rear of your vehicle to make you exit to inspect damage. If this happens in a suspicious location:
- Do not exit the vehicle
- Drive to the nearest police station or busy public location
- Call police en route

### Police Recommendations If Confronted

**The Universal Advice: Comply**

From [LAPD](https://www.lapdonline.org/carjacking/) and [Victoria Police](https://www.police.vic.gov.au/rideshare-driver-safety-and-carjacking):

> "If a carjacker threatens you with a gun or other weapon, give up your car. Do not argue. Your life is worth more than a car."

> "Do not resist or argue, especially if there is a weapon involved. Vehicles can be replaced, but you cannot."

**Specific Guidance:**
1. Give up keys and property without resistance
2. Do not argue, fight, or chase the offender
3. Exit the vehicle and move away
4. Be a good witness - note appearance, direction of travel, vehicle details
5. Report immediately to police

**The Exception - Kidnapping Attempts:**
From [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/article/how-to-prevent-auto-theft-and-carjacking):

> "Never agree to be kidnapped. Drop the car keys and run and scream for help."

If the goal is to take you as well as the vehicle:
- This is a life-threatening situation requiring different response
- Create distance - drop keys and run
- Attract attention - scream, activate car alarm
- Defend yourself as a last resort if escape is not possible

**Remember:**
- Average carjacking involves 3-5 offenders, some or all armed
- Resisting can escalate aggression
- Your safety, and your family's safety, is the priority

## 5. Vehicle as Safety Tool

### When to Drive Away From a Threat

The vehicle provides significant protection and mobility. In threatening situations, the ability to drive away is your primary advantage.

**Appropriate Scenarios:**
- Being followed by a suspicious vehicle
- Approached by threatening individuals while stopped
- Road rage escalation
- Any situation where you feel unsafe

**How to Execute:**
1. Keep doors locked and windows up
2. If safe to drive, do so immediately
3. Do not drive home - drive to a police station, hospital, or busy public location
4. Call 000 if the threat is immediate
5. Use horn continuously if needed to alert others

### Using the Vehicle Horn

From expert guidance and [Wocl Leydon](https://www.woclleydon.com/blog/what-to-do-if-protesters-attack-your-car/):
- Use horn to draw attention to your situation
- Continuous honking alerts pedestrians and other drivers
- Can deter attackers who prefer not to be noticed
- Car alarm serves similar attention-drawing function

### Driving to Safe Locations

**Recommended Safe Locations:**
1. Police station
2. Fire station
3. Hospital emergency department
4. Busy petrol station (with 24-hour operation)
5. Any busy public location with witnesses

**Key Points:**
- Never drive to your home if being followed
- Stay on main roads with traffic
- Keep phone accessible to call for help
- If you cannot drive away safely, stay in locked vehicle and call 000

### Legal Considerations in Australia

From [Wikipedia - Self-Defence (Australia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defence_(Australia)) and [Attorney-General's Department](https://www.ag.gov.au/crime/publications/commonwealth-criminal-code-guide-practitioners-draft/part-23-circumstances-which-there-no-criminal-responsibility/division-10-circumstances-involving-external-factors/104-self-defence):

Self-defence in Australian law requires:
1. **Genuine belief:** You reasonably believed you were threatened with death or serious bodily harm
2. **Proportionate response:** The force used was reasonable and proportionate to the perceived threat

**The Two-Limb Test (NSW):**
- Subjective: You genuinely believed actions were necessary
- Objective: The response was reasonable in the circumstances

**Key Principles:**
- Driving away from a threat to reach safety is generally considered reasonable
- Excessive force can invalidate self-defence claims
- Your response must match the threat
- When in doubt, escape is always preferable to confrontation

**Important:** This is general information only. Specific legal situations require advice from a qualified legal professional.

## 6. Child Safety

### Queensland Child Restraint Laws

From [Queensland Government](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/safety/rules/children) and [Smith's Lawyers](https://www.smithslawyers.com.au/post/child-seat-safety-updates-qld):

**Age-Based Requirements:**

| Age | Requirement |
|-----|-------------|
| Birth to 6 months | Rear-facing restraint only |
| 6 months to 4 years | Rear-facing or forward-facing with built-in harness |
| 4 to 7 years | Forward-facing with harness OR booster seat with lap-sash seatbelt |
| 7+ years | Booster seat or adult seatbelt (see recommendations below) |

**Key Recommendations:**
- Keep children rear-facing as long as possible (often past age 2)
- Children should use booster seats until 145cm tall (average age 11)
- Rear seats are safest for all children
- Child restraints must comply with AS/NZS 1754 standard
- Use restraints less than 10 years old

**Front Seat Rules:**
- Children under 4: Not permitted in front seat if vehicle has two or more rows
- Children 4-7: Only in front seat if all other seats occupied by children under 7

**Penalties:** Queensland Police issue fines of $1,251 and four demerit points for each improperly restrained child. Repeat offenders face double demerits.

### The Five-Step Test for Transitioning from Booster Seat

Before moving to adult seatbelt only:
1. **Back:** Can the child sit with their entire back against the vehicle seat?
2. **Knee:** Do their knees bend comfortably over the front seat edge?
3. **Lap Belt:** Does it sit low across hip bones, touching thighs?
4. **Sash Belt:** Does it cross the middle of the shoulder (not neck or arm)?
5. **Stay:** Can they maintain this position for the entire trip?

All five must be "yes" before transitioning.

### Teaching Children About Car Safety

**Basic Rules for Young Children:**
From [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/child-safety):
- Never play in or around cars
- Trunks are for cargo, not playing
- Always wait for an adult before approaching or entering a vehicle
- Stay still and hold hands in parking lots

**Age-Appropriate Information:**
- Children as young as 2-3 can learn their parents' full names
- Older children can memorize phone numbers and addresses
- Teach them how to call 000 in an emergency

### Stranger Safety and Vehicles

From [Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/stranger-danger-and-stranger-safety) and [Children's Hospital Pittsburgh](https://www.chp.edu/injury-prevention/safety/street/stranger-danger):

**Key Teaching Points:**
- Never get in a car with someone unless parent has given explicit permission
- Never accept anything from strangers
- Most abduction attempts involve offering a ride, candy, money, or showing animals
- Peak risk: children ages 10-14, between 2pm and 7pm

**If Separated or Lost:**
1. Stay put - chances of being found quickly are better
2. If feeling unsafe, go to the nearest safe place (store, employee, security guard)
3. Look for people in uniforms (police, security, store employees with name badges)
4. Do not leave the location
5. Know parents' full names and phone numbers

**Focus on Behaviors, Not Just "Strangers":**
Teaching children to watch for "strange behaviors" is more effective than "stranger danger" because:
- Children may not recognize someone as a "stranger" if they have seen them before
- "Nice-looking" people do not seem threatening to children
- Most child abductions involve someone the child knows

## 7. Breakdown and Roadside Safety

### Safe Procedures for Breakdowns

From [Queensland Government](https://www.qld.gov.au/transport/vehicle-safety/crashes-and-breakdowns/breakdown-safety) and [NSW Government](https://www.nsw.gov.au/driving-boating-and-transport/roads-safety-and-rules/warnings-and-hazards/breakdowns):

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Exit the road if possible** - get off highways/motorways to lower-speed environments
2. **Activate hazard lights** immediately
3. **Pull over safely** to hard shoulder or breakdown lane, as far from traffic as possible
4. **Turn wheels away from traffic** - if struck from behind, this directs the car away from the road
5. **Raise the bonnet** (if safe) to signal breakdown to passing motorists

**On Highways and Motorways:**

**When to Exit the Vehicle:**
- If there is a barrier or safe space away from traffic
- Exit through the passenger side (away from traffic)
- Move behind barrier or as far from traffic as possible
- Never open the driver's door into traffic

**When to Stay in the Vehicle:**
- In a tunnel or on a bridge with no safe space
- On a narrow shoulder with fast-moving traffic
- When exiting would put you closer to traffic
- Stay with seatbelt fastened - this is your best protection if struck

**Critical:** Never attempt to change a tyre on the traffic side of a highway. It is extremely dangerous. Call roadside assistance.

### Remote Area Breakdowns

**Golden Rule:** Do not leave your vehicle.

- Do not send passengers away to seek help
- It is easy to become lost or dehydrated when walking in remote Australia
- Always carry adequate water supplies when traveling to remote locations
- Stay with the vehicle - it provides shelter and is easier to spot for rescuers

### Emergency Contact Numbers

**Roadside Assistance:**

| Service | Phone Number | Coverage |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| RACQ (Queensland) | 13 11 11 | Queensland |
| NRMA | 13 11 11 or 13 11 22 | NSW, ACT, SA |
| RACV (Victoria) | 13 11 11 | Victoria |
| RAC (Western Australia) | 13 17 03 | WA |

**Interstate Coverage:** All state motoring clubs have reciprocal arrangements - your membership provides basic coverage nationwide.

**Emergency Services:** 000 (life-threatening emergencies only)

### Being Prepared

**Prevention:**
- Check fuel, oil, water, and tyre pressure (including spare) regularly
- Keep a high-visibility vest and torch in the vehicle
- Save roadside assistance contacts in your phone
- Keep a breakdown safety guide in your glove box
- Carry jumper leads, torch, and reflective triangle

### Rules for Other Motorists

**Slow Down for Breakdowns:**
- Victoria: Slow to 40 km/h when passing stationary emergency, law enforcement, and roadside assistance vehicles with flashing lights
- South Australia: Slow to 25 km/h when seeing flashing amber lights ahead

---

## Summary: Key Principles

### The Five Pillars of Vehicle Safety

1. **Awareness:** Stay alert, scan surroundings, trust your instincts
2. **Preparedness:** Maintain vehicle, keep emergency kit, know emergency numbers
3. **Compliance:** If confronted, prioritize life over property - comply with demands
4. **Escape:** The vehicle provides mobility - drive to safety when possible
5. **Communication:** Call for help, be a good witness, report incidents

### Teaching Points for Families

**For Adults:**
- Lock doors immediately, keep windows up
- Have keys ready before approaching the vehicle
- Maintain escape routes while driving
- Know where safe locations are in your regular routes
- Practice calm decision-making

**For Children:**
- S.T.A.R. method in parking lots
- Never enter vehicles without parent permission
- Know parents' names and phone numbers
- If lost, stay put and find a uniformed adult
- Vehicle rules (seatbelts, staying still, no playing around cars)

### Final Note

The overwhelming majority of driving and vehicle use is safe and uneventful. These preparations are about being ready for rare situations while maintaining normal, confident daily life. Awareness and preparation, not fear, are the goals.
