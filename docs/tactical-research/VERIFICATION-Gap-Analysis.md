# Gap Analysis: The Lethal Gentleman's Curriculum

**Purpose:** Identify missing topics and blind spots in the current tactical training curriculum for an Australian family man (Sunshine Coast, Queensland).

**Review Date:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

The current curriculum is comprehensive in six core domains:
1. **Combat/Self-Defense** - Well covered (Krav Maga, BJJ, boxing research; legal framework; mindset psychology)
2. **Medical/Trauma** - Excellent (TCCC, Stop the Bleed, MARCH protocol, Queensland legal considerations)
3. **Home Security** - Strong (physical reinforcement, CPTED, electronics, thermal cameras)
4. **Digital Privacy** - Thorough (smartphone, network, encryption, data brokers)
5. **Vehicle Prep** - Good (defensive driving, carjacking awareness, child safety)
6. **Communications** - Solid (amateur radio, mesh networks, Meshtastic, WICEN)

However, **significant gaps exist** in areas critical to Australian family preparedness:

| Gap Category | Risk Level | Current Coverage |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| Natural Disasters (cyclone, flood, bushfire) | HIGH | Minimal (cyclone shelter only) |
| Economic/Supply Chain Disruption | HIGH | None |
| Child-Specific Protection Protocols | MEDIUM-HIGH | Partial (vehicle safety only) |
| Family Communication Protocols | MEDIUM | Mentioned but not detailed |
| Food/Water Storage | HIGH | None |
| Financial Resilience | HIGH | None |
| Community Building | MEDIUM-HIGH | Acknowledged in Inversion Analysis, not developed |
| Professional Training Requirements | MEDIUM | Scattered references |

## Recommendations for Curriculum Development

### New Research Documents Needed

1. **Australian-Natural-Disaster-Preparedness.md**
   - Cyclone, flood, bushfire specific guidance
   - Queensland focus with broader applicability

2. **Food-Water-Storage-Basics.md**
   - Practical storage guidance for Australian climate
   - Rotation systems and minimum targets

3. **Financial-Resilience-Fundamentals.md**
   - Emergency funds, insurance review
   - Documentation security

4. **Child-Safety-Age-Specific-Protocols.md**
   - Developmental stage-appropriate education
   - Online safety included

5. **Family-Communication-Plan-Template.md**
   - Actionable template
   - Code words, rally points, contact trees

6. **Community-Building-For-Security.md**
   - Practical steps for neighborhood integration
   - Mutual aid network development

### Integration with Existing Curriculum

The Curriculum-Design-Psychology.md document should be updated to incorporate:
- Natural disaster response as a skill category
- Family coordination expanded with communication protocols
- Financial resilience as a foundational element
- Community integration as a parallel track to individual capability

---

## Conclusion

The current curriculum excels in tactical capability development but underweights:

1. **The most statistically likely threats** (natural disasters vs violent crime)
2. **System-level resilience** (financial, supply chain, community)
3. **Child-specific protection** beyond vehicle safety
4. **Family coordination infrastructure**

The Inversion Analysis correctly identified that "the curriculum is heavily weighted toward the lowest-probability scenarios." This Gap Analysis provides specific topics to address that imbalance while maintaining the curriculum's strengths in physical security and personal capability.

The goal remains a flourishing family life with appropriate preparation - not maximizing capability at the expense of normal living.
