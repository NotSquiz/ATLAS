## 1. MARCH Protocol (Military Trauma Priority)

The MARCH framework is the gold standard for trauma assessment, developed from Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines. It prioritizes interventions based on what kills trauma patients fastest.

### The MARCH Sequence

| Priority | Component | Focus |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **M** | Massive Hemorrhage | Life-threatening bleeding |
| **A** | Airway | Assessment and management |
| **R** | Respiration | Chest injuries, breathing |
| **C** | Circulation | Shock recognition/treatment |
| **H** | Hypothermia/Head | Temperature management, head injury |

### Why This Order Matters

**Massive hemorrhage comes first** because:
- More than 90% of 4,596 combat deaths post-9/11 died of hemorrhage-associated injuries
- Hemorrhagic shock is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 1-46 years
- A person can bleed out in as little as 3 minutes
- It accounts for approximately 35% of prehospital deaths and 40% of deaths within 24 hours
- Hemorrhage is the leading **preventable** cause of death in trauma

Traditional ABC (Airway-Breathing-Circulation) is outdated for trauma. The military learned that stopping massive bleeding before addressing airway saves more lives.

### MARCH in Detail

**M - Massive Hemorrhage**
- Apply tourniquet for life-threatening extremity bleeding
- Use hemostatic gauze and wound packing for junctional wounds
- Direct pressure for other compressible bleeding

**A - Airway**
- Position unconscious casualty (head-tilt chin-lift or jaw thrust)
- Recovery position if breathing but unconscious
- Clear obstructions

**R - Respiration**
- Check for chest wounds (sucking chest wound)
- Apply chest seal if penetrating chest injury
- Monitor for tension pneumothorax signs

**C - Circulation**
- Assess for signs of shock
- Elevate legs if no spinal injury suspected
- Continue monitoring bleeding control

**H - Hypothermia/Head Injury**
- Prevent heat loss immediately
- Insulate from ground
- Cover with emergency blanket
- Protect head/cervical spine

## 2. Bleeding Control (Hemorrhage)

### The Three Methods (Stop the Bleed)

#### Method 1: Direct Pressure

**When to use**: Non-life-threatening wounds, wounds not deep enough to pack

**Technique**:
1. Use your hands to apply firm, steady pressure
2. Press directly on the bleeding site
3. Hold pressure for at least 5 minutes before looking
4. Ensure casualty is on a firm surface for leverage
5. Do NOT release pressure to check the wound
6. If blood soaks through, add more material on top - do not remove original dressing

**Key Points**:
- Focus pressure on the exact location of bleeding
- Use body weight if necessary
- Continue until help arrives or bleeding stops

#### Method 2: Wound Packing

**When to use**: Deep wounds where blood is pooling inside, wounds in areas where tourniquet cannot be applied (groin, armpit, neck)

**Technique**:
1. Expose the wound (cut clothing away)
2. Wipe away pooled blood
3. Pack gauze **into** the wound, starting at the deepest point
4. Push gauze directly against the bleeding vessel at base of wound
5. Continue packing until wound cavity is filled 1-2 inches above skin level
6. Apply direct pressure on top for minimum 3 minutes
7. Maintain pressure until help arrives

**Hemostatic Gauze**:
- Combat Gauze, ChitoGauze, and Celox Gauze are CoTCCC-recommended
- Contains agents (kaolin, chitosan) that accelerate clotting
- Must contact bleeding source directly
- Approximately 90% success rate when properly applied
- Hold pressure for minimum 3 minutes with hemostatic gauze

**Where NOT to Pack**:
- Chest wounds (risk of tension pneumothorax)
- Abdominal wounds (bleeding source too deep)
- Pelvic wounds (bleeding source too deep)
- Neck wounds require caution (airway compromise risk)

#### Method 3: Tourniquet Application

**When to use**:
- Life-threatening extremity bleeding
- Bleeding that cannot be controlled with direct pressure
- Multiple casualties (apply tourniquet, move on)
- Tactical situations requiring immediate mobility

**Technique (CAT Tourniquet)**:
1. Place tourniquet 2-3 inches above the wound (closer to torso)
2. Do NOT place directly over the wound
3. Do NOT place over a joint (elbow, knee)
4. Pull strap tight
5. Twist windlass until bleeding STOPS completely
6. Secure windlass in clip/holder
7. Note time of application (write on tourniquet or skin)
8. Do NOT remove once applied

**Key Points**:
- "High and tight" - if unsure of wound location, apply high on limb
- Tighten until bleeding stops - this will be painful
- A second tourniquet may be needed (place above first)
- Can be applied over clothing if necessary
- Mark/document time of application

### Tourniquet Selection

| Tourniquet | Key Features | Considerations |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| **CAT-7** | Most widely used, highest correct application rate (92.2%), plastic windlass | Current gold standard |
| **SOFTT-W** | Aluminum windlass (more durable), detachable buckle, more compact storage | Preferred by some special operations |
| **SAM XT** | Audible click when tight enough, aluminum windlass | Recall history - verify current version |

**Research Findings**:
- CAT7 and SAM-XT showed similar hemorrhage control (67.7% and 73.3%)
- SOFTT-W showed lower hemorrhage control rate (35%) in studies
- CAT has highest correct application rate among users
- All three are CoTCCC-recommended

**Time Limits**:
- Safe for 2 hours with minimal complication risk
- Current TCCC guidelines recommend conversion attempt within 2 hours if possible
- After 6 hours, do NOT remove (cardiovascular collapse risk)
- No amputations in US military with application time under 2 hours

### Tourniquet Myths Debunked

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Tourniquets cause amputation" | No amputations directly from tourniquet use under 2 hours in US military data |
| "Last resort only" | Outdated - tourniquets should be FIRST treatment for life-threatening extremity bleeding |
| "Will cause limb loss" | Studies show tourniquet use is NOT associated with limb loss in military trauma |
| "Too dangerous for civilians" | FDA classifies as Class 1 (Low Risk) medical device |
| "Improvised is just as good" | Commercial tourniquets significantly outperform improvised versions |

### Junctional Hemorrhage

**Definition**: Bleeding at junction of torso and limbs (groin, armpit, neck, shoulder) where standard tourniquets cannot be applied

**Treatment Priority**:
1. **Direct digital pressure** - First attempt, press directly on wound
2. **Wound packing with hemostatic gauze** - Pack wound cavity, maintain pressure 3+ minutes
3. **Junctional tourniquet device** (if available):
   - SAM Junctional Tourniquet (can be applied in 25 seconds)
   - AAJT (Abdominal Aortic and Junctional Tourniquet)
   - CRoC (Combat Ready Clamp)

**Neck Wounds**:
- Pack with hemostatic gauze
- Fill wound cavity 1-2 inches above skin
- Apply firm, continuous manual pressure for minimum 3 minutes
- Direct pressure usually sufficient - avoid circumferential pressure

**Key Challenge**: 19% of preventable battlefield deaths between 2001-2011 involved junctional hemorrhage. These are difficult wounds requiring sustained direct pressure.

## 3. Airway Management

### Basic Airway Anatomy

When someone is unconscious, all muscles relax. The tongue (attached to back of jaw) falls against the back wall of the throat and blocks air entry to the lungs.

### Head Tilt-Chin Lift

**When to use**: Unconscious casualty WITHOUT suspected neck/spine injury

**Technique**:
1. Place one hand on the patient's forehead
2. Place other hand under the chin (bony part)
3. Gently tilt head back
4. Lift chin upward
5. This moves tongue away from back of throat

**Contraindicated**: Suspected cervical spine injury

### Jaw Thrust Maneuver

**When to use**: Unconscious casualty WITH suspected neck/spine injury

**Technique**:
1. Position yourself at head of casualty
2. Place palms on patient's temples
3. Place fingers under the mandibular rami (angle of jaw)
4. Lift mandible upward and forward
5. Lower incisors should rise higher than upper incisors
6. Keep head and neck in neutral position (no movement)

**Critical Note**: If jaw thrust fails to open airway, perform head tilt-chin lift anyway. **Airway takes priority over spine precautions.**

### Infant Airway

**Key Differences**:
- Keep head in NEUTRAL position (not tilted back)
- The infant trachea is soft and pliable
- Maximum head tilt can distort and close the airway
- Support jaw from falling back
- Use minimal extension

### Recovery Position

**When to use**: Unconscious but BREATHING casualty

**Purpose**: Protects airway, allows drainage of fluids, prevents aspiration

**Technique**:
1. Kneel beside casualty
2. Extend their arm nearest to you above their head
3. Bend their far knee
4. Roll them gently onto their side toward you
5. Adjust head and chin to ensure clear airway
6. Position top leg to stabilize (knee bent, foot on ground)
7. Monitor closely for changes

**Do NOT use if**:
- Suspected spinal injury (unless vomiting risk is higher)
- Need to perform CPR
- Major injuries requiring supine position

### Choking (Foreign Body Airway Obstruction)

**Conscious Adult/Child - Mild Obstruction**:
- Encourage coughing
- Stay with them and monitor

**Conscious Adult/Child - Severe Obstruction**:
1. Give up to 5 back blows between shoulder blades
2. If unsuccessful, give up to 5 chest thrusts (or abdominal thrusts for adults)
3. Alternate between back blows and thrusts
4. Continue until obstruction cleared or unconscious

**Chest Thrusts**:
- Same location as CPR compressions
- Sharper and delivered at slower rate than CPR

**Unconscious Choking Victim**:
- Call for help
- Begin CPR
- Check mouth for visible object before each breath attempt

**Choking Infant**:
1. Position face-down on forearm, head lower than chest
2. Give 5 back blows between shoulder blades
3. Turn over, give 5 chest thrusts (two fingers, center of chest)
4. Alternate until clear or unconscious
5. If unconscious, begin infant CPR

### When Airway Adjuncts May Be Needed

Basic first aid typically does not include airway adjuncts, but recognize when advanced intervention is needed:
- Positioning alone fails to maintain airway
- Continuous blood/fluid in airway
- Facial trauma preventing positioning
- Unconscious with ongoing vomiting

---

## 4. Chest Injuries

### Recognizing Tension Pneumothorax

**What It Is**: Air trapped in chest cavity that cannot escape, progressively compressing the lung and shifting organs

**Signs and Symptoms** (progressive):
- Severe difficulty breathing (dyspnea)
- Decreased breath sounds on affected side
- Tracheal deviation (late sign - windpipe shifts away from affected side)
- Distended neck veins (jugular venous distension)
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Cyanosis (blue coloring)
- Rapid deterioration

**Critical Point**: Tension pneumothorax can develop AFTER applying a chest seal to an open wound. Constant reassessment is essential.

### Open Chest Wound (Sucking Chest Wound)

**Recognition**:
- Hole in chest wall
- Sucking/hissing sound with breathing
- Bubbling blood from wound
- Respiratory distress

**Treatment**:
1. Expose wound (cut away clothing)
2. Apply commercial chest seal (vented preferred)
3. Position semi-upright if possible
4. Monitor constantly for tension pneumothorax

### Chest Seals: Vented vs. Non-Vented

| Type | Mechanism | Advantages | Considerations |
|------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Vented** | One-way valve allows air out, blocks air in | Reduces tension pneumothorax risk | Valve can clog with blood |
| **Non-Vented** | Complete seal | Simpler design | Higher tension pneumothorax risk |

**Current TCCC Recommendation**: Use vented chest seal if available. If non-vented, "burp" the seal or remove temporarily if tension signs develop.

**Research Findings**:
- Both types provide immediate improvement in breathing and oxygenation
- Non-vented seals led to tension pneumothorax in studies with ongoing air leak
- Vented seals prevented tension pneumothorax in same studies
- Hyfin, Sentinel, and SAM seals (all vented) showed similar efficacy

**If No Commercial Seal Available**:
- Use any airtight material (plastic packaging, petroleum gauze)
- Tape on all four sides (3-sided taping is no longer recommended per current guidelines)
- Monitor closely for tension signs

**Critical Action for Tension Signs**:
If casualty develops worsening dyspnea, hypotension, or distended neck veins after seal application:
1. "Burp" or temporarily remove the seal to release trapped air
2. Reapply once pressure released
3. Continue monitoring

### Rib Fractures

**Recognition**:
- Pain at injury site
- Pain worse with breathing, coughing, or movement
- Tenderness on palpation
- Possible crepitus (crackling sensation)
- Shallow breathing (splinting)

**First Aid**:
- Support injured area (casualty's arm across chest)
- Encourage deep breathing despite pain (prevent pneumonia)
- Position of comfort (usually sitting up)
- Do NOT bind or wrap chest (restricts breathing)
- Monitor for respiratory distress

### Flail Chest

**Definition**: 3+ adjacent ribs broken in 2+ places, creating a free-floating segment

**Recognition**:
- **Paradoxical movement**: Affected segment moves OPPOSITE to rest of chest
  - Segment moves IN during inhalation
  - Segment moves OUT during exhalation
- Severe pain
- Respiratory distress
- Crepitus
- Visible deformity

**First Aid**:
1. Call for emergency help immediately (life-threatening)
2. Position of comfort (usually sitting/semi-upright)
3. Stabilize flail segment with firm pad or your hand
4. Hold segment in place to prevent paradoxical movement
5. Monitor airway and breathing
6. Treat for shock

**Prognosis**: 10-25% mortality rate; commonly accompanied by lung contusion

## 5. Shock Recognition and Management

### What is Hemorrhagic Shock?

Hemorrhagic shock occurs when blood loss causes inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery. The body can compensate initially, but will decompensate rapidly without intervention.

### Stages of Shock

| Stage | Blood Loss | Signs |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Class I** | Up to 15% (~750ml) | Minimal symptoms, slight tachycardia |
| **Class II** | 15-30% (~750-1500ml) | Tachycardia, narrowed pulse pressure, anxiety |
| **Class III** | 30-40% (~1500-2000ml) | Marked tachycardia, hypotension, confusion |
| **Class IV** | >40% (>2000ml) | Severe hypotension, lethargy, imminent death |

### Early Signs (Compensated Shock)

Recognize these BEFORE blood pressure drops:
- **Tachycardia** (rapid heart rate) - earliest sign
- **Tachypnea** (rapid breathing)
- **Narrowed pulse pressure** (difference between systolic and diastolic decreases)
- **Cool extremities** (blood shunted to vital organs)
- **Delayed capillary refill** (>2 seconds)
- **Anxiety/restlessness**
- **Pale, cool skin**
- **Thirst**

### Late Signs (Decompensated Shock)

At this stage, intervention is critical:
- **Hypotension** (low blood pressure - late sign)
- **Altered mental status** (confusion, lethargy)
- **Weak, thready pulse**
- **Gray/mottled skin**
- **Decreased urine output** (oliguria)
- **Loss of consciousness**

### First Aid Management

**The ABCs of Shock Treatment**:

1. **Control Bleeding** (Most important - address the cause)
   - Apply tourniquet, direct pressure, wound packing as appropriate
   - This is THE primary treatment for hemorrhagic shock

2. **Call Emergency Services**
   - Shock requires hospital treatment
   - Transport is critical

3. **Position the Casualty**
   - Lay flat with legs elevated 12 inches (30 cm) if no contraindication
   - This returns blood to vital organs
   - **Do NOT elevate legs if**:
     - Head injury
     - Spinal injury suspected
     - Leg fracture
     - Abdominal injury
     - Difficulty breathing (may need semi-sitting)

4. **Prevent Heat Loss** (Critical)
   - 66% of trauma patients become hypothermic
   - Cover with blankets/emergency blanket
   - Insulate from ground
   - Protect from wind and elements

5. **Monitor and Reassure**
   - Keep casualty calm and still
   - Monitor level of consciousness
   - Re-check bleeding control
   - Do NOT give food or fluids by mouth

### Positioning for Shock

| Condition | Position |
|-----------|----------|
| Standard shock (no contraindications) | Supine, legs elevated 12 inches |
| Head injury | Supine, head slightly elevated |
| Difficulty breathing | Semi-sitting |
| Spinal injury suspected | Do not move, maintain position |
| Abdominal injury | Supine, knees bent if comfortable |
| Unconscious, breathing | Recovery position |

### Heat Retention (Hypothermia Prevention)

**Why It Matters**:
- 9.3% of civilian trauma patients arrive at hospital hypothermic
- A 3-degree drop (to 34C/93F) increases mortality by 28%
- Hypothermia worsens coagulation (clotting ability)
- 40% of trauma deaths directly result from hemorrhage - hypothermia makes this worse

**Methods**:

1. **Passive Warming** (prevent heat loss):
   - Remove wet clothing
   - Cover with dry blankets/layers
   - Emergency/space blanket (reflects 90% of radiant heat)
   - Insulate from ground (major heat loss pathway)
   - Protect from wind

2. **Active Warming** (if available):
   - Commercial heat packs
   - Place in armpits and groin (high blood flow areas)
   - Do NOT place directly on skin (burn risk)
   - Body-to-body contact in survival situations

**Best Practice** (Military Protocol):
- Place casualty in Blizzard Bag or HPMK if available
- Studies show these significantly outperform mylar blankets alone
- Enclose with exterior impermeable barrier
- Add insulation (wool blankets, sleeping bag) inside barrier

## 6. Casualty Movement

### When to Move vs. Shelter in Place

**Move When**:
- Immediate threat to life remains (fire, gunfire, building collapse)
- Casualty needs medical care beyond your capability
- Environment is immediately hazardous
- Evacuation assets are available

**Shelter in Place When**:
- Scene is safe
- Casualty has spinal injury suspected
- Movement would cause further injury
- Help is coming to you
- You lack resources for safe movement

### Dragging Techniques

**Use When**: Immediate extraction needed, cannot lift, low crawl required

#### Shoulder/Clothes Drag

**Technique**:
1. Grasp clothing at shoulders (collar, shirt)
2. Keep casualty's head/neck aligned with body
3. Stay low, use your legs to push backward
4. Keep head-neck-chest axis straight
5. Drag in direction of casualty's head

**Preferred Because**: Supports head, unlike ankle drag

#### Cradle Drop Drag

**Use For**: Transporting in semi-sitting position, limited distance

#### Blanket/Poncho Drag

**Technique**:
1. Roll casualty onto blanket/poncho
2. Gather material at head end
3. Drag from head end
4. Material protects from ground friction

**Advantages**: Reduces friction injuries, easier on rescuer

### Cautions with Drags

- Casualties can be injured by friction during long drags
- Ground surface matters - rocks, debris cause additional injury
- Ankle drags cause head bouncing - avoid unless necessary
- Practice areas are often smooth - reality is not
- Short distance extraction only when possible

### Carries (One Person)

#### Fireman's Carry

**Best For**: Unconscious or disabled casualty, moderate to long distance

**Advantages**:
- Leaves one hand free
- Weight distributed across both shoulders
- Casualty's torso remains fairly level
- Can be maintained for 50+ feet

**Technique**:
1. Face casualty, grasp wrists
2. Pull casualty up and across your shoulders
3. Pass arm between casualty's legs
4. Grasp their wrist through legs
5. Other hand free for balance/weapon

**Limitations**:
- Cannot see casualty's vital areas
- Become top-heavy (balance issues on uneven ground)
- Not suitable for certain injuries

#### Pack-Strap Carry

**Best For**: Conscious or unconscious casualty, moderate distance

**Technique**:
1. Back into casualty
2. Pull their arms over your shoulders
3. Lean forward, lift with legs
4. Casualty's weight on your back

#### Support Carry

**Best For**: Conscious casualty who can walk/hop, long distance

**Technique**:
1. Stand on casualty's injured side
2. Place their arm over your shoulders
3. Support around waist
4. Walk together, taking weight

### Carries (Two Person)

#### Fore-and-Aft Carry

**Best For**: Conscious or unconscious casualty, long distance

**Technique**:
1. One rescuer at head (under arms, across chest)
2. One rescuer at feet (under knees)
3. Lift together on count
4. Walk in step

**Advantages**: Less tiring, preferred for long distance

#### Two-Person Chair Carry

**Best For**: Conscious casualty, stairs or confined spaces

**Technique**:
1. Create "seat" with interlocked arms
2. Casualty places arms around rescuers' shoulders
3. Lift together

### Improvised Stretchers

**When Needed**: Long distance transport, multiple rescuers available, casualty cannot be carried

**Blanket Stretcher**:
1. Lay blanket flat
2. Roll edges inward on each long side
3. Four rescuers grasp rolled edges
4. Lift together

**Jacket/Shirt Stretcher**:
1. Button/zip two jackets closed
2. Turn inside out (arms inside)
3. Pass poles through sleeves
4. Creates rigid litter

**Key Principles**:
- Test improvised stretcher before loading casualty
- Support head and neck during loading
- Secure casualty to prevent rolling
- Walk in step, communicate

### Choosing Movement Method

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Casualty condition | Injuries, consciousness, weight |
| Distance | Short = drag, Long = carry/stretcher |
| Terrain | Uneven = lower carries, Stairs = chair carry |
| Number of rescuers | Solo = limited options, Multiple = more options |
| Threat level | Active threat = speed priority |
| Your fitness | Assess honestly - don't become a casualty |

## 9. Legal Considerations (Queensland)

### Good Samaritan Laws in Queensland

**Important**: Queensland is UNIQUE among Australian states regarding Good Samaritan protection.

**How Queensland Differs**:
- Queensland does NOT have blanket Good Samaritan protection for bystanders
- Protection applies only to members of listed organizations when performing duties
- The Civil Liability Act 2003 (Qld) Part 1, Division 7 covers "Enhancement of Public Safety" rather than general Good Samaritan protection

### Who IS Protected in Queensland

Under Civil Liability Act 2003 (Qld) Section 26(1), protection applies when:
1. First aid is given while performing duties for a **prescribed entity**
2. Assistance is given in circumstances of emergency
3. Act is done in good faith
4. Without reckless disregard for safety

**Prescribed Entities** include (per Civil Liability Regulation 2014):
- Healthcare workers (doctors, nurses, paramedics)
- St John Ambulance members
- Red Cross members
- Surf Life Saving members
- Volunteer rescue organizations
- Other listed organizations

### For Regular Bystanders in Queensland

**Key Points**:
- No specific statutory immunity for random bystanders who step in
- This does NOT mean you should not help
- Common law may still provide some protection for genuine emergency assistance
- No Australian Good Samaritan (including in QLD) has ever been successfully sued for rendering assistance

### General Australian Context

**Other states DO have broader protection**:
- Most states provide immunity if assistance given:
  - In good faith
  - Without expectation of payment
  - Not under influence of drugs/alcohol
  - Did not cause the emergency

### Practical Guidelines

**Do**:
- Act within your training level
- Use reasonable care and skill
- Act in good faith (genuine attempt to help)
- Only do what you are trained to do
- Call emergency services (000)
- Document actions if possible

**Do Not**:
- Attempt procedures beyond your training
- Act recklessly
- Move casualty unnecessarily (especially if spinal injury suspected)
- Abandon casualty once you start helping
- Accept payment for assistance

### Scope of Care for Non-Medical Personnel

**You CAN**:
- Apply direct pressure to wounds
- Apply tourniquets
- Pack wounds
- Open airway (head-tilt chin-lift, jaw thrust)
- Position unconscious casualty
- Perform CPR
- Use AED
- Apply chest seal to open wound
- Keep casualty warm
- Call for help

**You SHOULD NOT** (without medical certification):
- Administer medications (with limited exceptions)
- Perform needle decompression
- Insert airways (beyond basic positioning)
- Make diagnosis
- Suture wounds
- Reduce fractures/dislocations

### When to Call Emergency Services (000)

**Always Call For**:
- Life-threatening bleeding
- Unconsciousness
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain
- Suspected spinal injury
- Severe burns
- Signs of shock
- Any trauma requiring more than basic first aid

**Information to Provide**:
- Location (be specific)
- Nature of emergency
- Number of casualties
- Current condition
- What assistance being provided
- Any hazards at scene

### Documentation Considerations

**Why Document**:
- Medical personnel need information
- May protect you legally
- Aids continuity of care

**What to Document** (if safely possible):
- Time of incident
- What you observed
- What interventions performed (e.g., tourniquet time)
- Any changes in condition
- What emergency services advised

**How to Document**:
- Write on casualty (tourniquet time on forehead)
- Casualty card if available
- Phone notes/photos
- Write on tape applied to casualty
- Verbal handover to EMS with key times
