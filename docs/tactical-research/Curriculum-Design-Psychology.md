## 1. Learning Psychology Foundations

### 1.1 The Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition

The Dreyfus model, developed by brothers Stuart and Hubert Dreyfus, describes how adults progress from novice to expert through five distinct stages:

| Stage | Characteristics | Decision-Making | Context Sensitivity |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Novice** | Follows rigid rules, no context sensitivity | Rule-based | None |
| **Advanced Beginner** | Recognizes situational aspects, limited understanding | Modified rules based on experience | Limited |
| **Competent** | Can prioritize, plan, develop routines | Conscious deliberation | Moderate |
| **Proficient** | Sees situations holistically, knows what to do | Intuitive recognition | High |
| **Expert** | Fluid, automatic performance, transcends rules | Intuitive, immediate | Complete |

**Application to Protective Skills:**

- **Novice (Months 1-3):** Must consciously follow checklists. "When entering, scan left-right-center." Cannot improvise.
- **Advanced Beginner (Months 4-6):** Starts recognizing "this feels wrong." Still needs rules but beginning to see patterns.
- **Competent (Months 7-12):** Can prioritize actions without a checklist. "This situation requires X response."
- **Proficient (Year 2):** Holistic perception. Sees threat developing before it manifests.
- **Expert (Years 3+):** Automatic, fluid. Response happens without conscious thought.

**Key Insight:** You cannot skip stages. Each builds on the previous. Attempting advanced training without foundations creates dangerous overconfidence.

### 1.2 Stress Inoculation Theory

Stress Inoculation Training (SIT), developed by Donald Meichenbaum, follows a three-phase model:

**Phase 1: Conceptualization (Education)**
- Understand what happens to your body under stress
- Learn about heart rate zones, tunnel vision, auditory exclusion
- Normalize the stress response - it's biology, not weakness
- Build conceptual framework for what you'll experience

**Phase 2: Skills Acquisition and Rehearsal**
- Learn techniques in low-stress environment
- Practice until movements become automatic
- Build cognitive coping strategies (tactical breathing, mantras)
- Progressive difficulty in training

**Phase 3: Application and Follow-Through**
- Apply skills under increasing stress
- Graduated exposure to realistic scenarios
- Feedback and refinement
- Integration into daily life

**The Stress Dose-Response Relationship:**

```
Performance
    ^
    |     /\
    |    /  \
    |   /    \
    |  /      \
    | /        \
    +-------------> Stress Level
    Low    Optimal    Excessive
```

- Too little stress: No adaptation occurs
- Optimal stress: Performance improves through adaptation
- Excessive stress: Performance degrades, learning inhibited, trauma possible

**Implication:** Training must progressively increase stress without exceeding the individual's current capacity. Start lower than you think necessary.

---

### 1.3 Skill Decay and Retention

**The Forgetting Curve (Ebbinghaus):**

Without practice, skills degrade predictably:
- 50% forgotten within 1 hour of learning
- 70% forgotten within 24 hours
- 90% forgotten within 1 week

**Combat Skill Decay Rates:**

| Skill Type | Without Practice | Time to Significant Degradation |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Fine motor (disassembly, locks) | Fastest decay | 2-4 weeks |
| Gross motor (strikes, escapes) | Moderate decay | 4-8 weeks |
| Cognitive (situational awareness) | Slowest decay if habitually practiced | 8-12 weeks |
| Procedural (first aid sequences) | Moderate-fast | 3-6 months |

**Countermeasures:**

1. **Spaced Repetition:** Practice at expanding intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month)
2. **Overlearning:** Train beyond initial competence (100% mastery, then 50% more reps)
3. **Varied Practice:** Same skill in different contexts
4. **Chunking:** Break complex sequences into smaller, memorable units
5. **Sleep Consolidation:** Skills consolidate during sleep; don't train late, train early

**Retention Priority Order:**
1. Practice high-consequence skills most frequently (bleeding control, escape)
2. Practice perishable skills (fine motor) more often than durable skills
3. Always refresh fundamentals before advancing

---

### 1.4 Transfer of Training

Transfer refers to how well training translates to real-world performance.

**Types of Transfer:**

| Transfer Type | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Positive** | Training improves real-world performance | Pad work improves striking ability in altercation |
| **Negative** | Training interferes with real-world performance | Sport techniques that don't work on hard surfaces |
| **Near** | Training environment similar to application | Force-on-force scenarios in realistic settings |
| **Far** | Training environment different from application | Classroom lectures on self-defense |

**Factors Affecting Transfer:**

1. **Contextual Similarity:** The more training resembles reality, the better transfer
2. **Stress State Similarity:** Skills learned relaxed may not be available under stress
3. **Equipment Similarity:** Train with what you'll actually have available
4. **Environmental Similarity:** Train in environments like those you frequent

**Implications for Curriculum:**
- Progress from controlled to realistic environments
- Include stress as a training variable
- Train in your actual home, car, neighborhood
- Don't rely solely on gym/dojo training

---

### 1.5 Cognitive Load Management

**Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller):**

Working memory is limited (~4 items simultaneously). Overloading working memory prevents learning.

| Load Type | Description | Management Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Inherent complexity of material | Break into smaller chunks, sequence properly |
| **Extraneous** | Poor instruction design | Clear demonstrations, eliminate distractions |
| **Germane** | Mental effort for schema construction | Provide practice, examples, analogies |

**Application to Tactical Training:**

**Wrong Approach:** Teach 10 techniques in one session
**Right Approach:** Teach 2-3 techniques, practice extensively, then add more

**The "One Plus One" Rule:**
- When teaching someone under stress, give ONE instruction
- Wait for completion
- Then give the next instruction
- This applies to self-instruction during incidents as well

**Automaticity Goal:**
Through repetitive practice, move skills from working memory (limited) to procedural memory (unlimited). The goal is making basic skills automatic so working memory is free for decision-making.

### 1.6 Adult Learning Principles (Andragogy)

Adults learn differently from children. Knowles' principles:

| Principle | Implication | Application |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Self-Directed** | Adults want control over learning | Provide choices, self-assessment tools |
| **Experience-Based** | Adults relate new learning to past experience | Use analogies to existing knowledge |
| **Relevance-Oriented** | Adults need to know "why" | Connect every skill to real scenarios |
| **Problem-Centered** | Adults prefer problem-solving over content | Scenario-based learning over lectures |
| **Intrinsic Motivation** | Adults are motivated by internal factors | Connect to family protection, values |

**Design Implications:**
- Explain the "why" before the "how"
- Provide clear real-world applications
- Allow learner to self-pace where possible
- Use scenarios, not just drills
- Connect to personal values (protecting family)

**Skills Requiring Professional Evaluation:**

| Skill | Validation Method | Frequency |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Physical combat | Instructor feedback in class | Every 3 months if training |
| Medical | Stop the Bleed certification | Initial + every 2 years |
| First aid | HLTAID011 certification | Initial + every 3 years |
| Firearms (if applicable) | Licensed instruction | Per license requirements |
| Home security | QLD Police assessment | Initial |

**Why External Validation Matters:**
- Self-assessment has blind spots
- Instructors see errors you don't notice
- Certifications ensure baseline competence
- External standards prevent self-deception

---

### 5.4 Failure Criteria (When to Repeat)

**Automatic Repeat Required If:**

1. **Safety violation** during practice (dangerous technique application)
2. **Complete failure** to perform skill under observation
3. **Significant degradation** (>30%) under stress testing
4. **Unable to explain** why technique works (suggests rote memorization without understanding)
5. **Inconsistent performance** across multiple attempts (suggests insufficient automaticity)

**How to Repeat:**

1. Return to fundamentals (don't just repeat the test)
2. Increase practice frequency for 2 weeks
3. Identify specific failure point
4. Practice failure point in isolation
5. Reintegrate into full skill
6. Retest

### 6.2 Safe Stress Introduction Methods

**Physical Stress Introduction (Home-Based):**

| Method | Stress Level | Equipment Needed | Safety Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Cold shower | Moderate | None | Start 30 sec, build to 2+ min |
| Burpee sets | Moderate | None | 30 sec before drill |
| Breath holds | Mild-Moderate | None | Never in water alone |
| Sprint-drill cycles | Moderate | Space | Warm up first |
| Elevated HR sparring | High | Partner, pads | Protective equipment |

**Psychological Stress Introduction:**

| Method | Stress Level | Safety Notes |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Stranger observation | Mild | Have family member observe |
| Time limits | Mild | Countdown timer |
| Surprise initiation | Moderate | Partner starts drill unexpectedly |
| Verbal challenge | Moderate | Partner challenges decisions |
| Role-play scenarios | Moderate-High | Set clear boundaries first |
| Unknown scenarios | High | Debrief thoroughly after |

---

### 6.3 When Stress Training Becomes Counterproductive

**Warning Signs (Stop Training If):**

- **Physiological:** Uncontrollable shaking, nausea, hyperventilation that doesn't resolve
- **Psychological:** Flashbacks to previous trauma, panic attacks, dissociation
- **Performance:** Complete skill breakdown, worse than untrained response
- **Recovery:** Unable to return to baseline within 10-15 minutes post-drill
- **Emotional:** Excessive fear, anger, or distress lasting beyond session

**The Yerkes-Dodson Principle:**
Performance increases with stress UP TO A POINT. Beyond that point, performance degrades rapidly. Everyone's threshold is different.

**Recovery Requirements:**
- After Level 3 stress: 10-minute cooldown, tactical breathing
- After Level 4 stress: 15-minute debrief, discuss emotional state
- After Level 5 stress: Full AAR, may need extended recovery

---

### 6.4 Home-Based Stress Inoculation Methods

**Daily (5-10 minutes):**
- Cold water exposure (shower or basin)
- Box breathing during uncomfortable position (wall sit)
- Holding uncomfortable conversation (asking stranger for time)

**Weekly (30-60 minutes):**
- Sprint-drill cycles (physical stress)
- Partner surprise drills (psychological stress)
- Time-pressure skill practice

**Monthly (2-3 hours):**
- Full scenario practice with family
- Unknown scenario with partner
- External training class

**Physical Discomfort Progression:**

| Week | Cold Exposure | Other Stress |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| 1-2 | 30 sec cold shower | Hold ice cube 30 sec |
| 3-4 | 1 min cold shower | Wall sit 60 sec while reciting |
| 5-6 | 2 min cold shower | Uncomfortable conversation with stranger |
| 7-8 | Cold plunge 1 min | Elevated HR drilling |
| 9+ | Cold plunge 2-3 min | Combination stressors |

---

### 6.5 The "Inoculation Dose"

**Principle:** Like vaccines, you need enough stress to create adaptation but not so much that you overwhelm the system.

**Calibrating Your Dose:**

**Too Low (No Adaptation):**
- Training feels easy/comfortable
- Heart rate barely elevated
- No emotional response
- Performance feels effortless

**Optimal (Adaptation Occurring):**
- Training feels challenging but manageable
- Heart rate elevated but controllable
- Some anxiety/discomfort present
- Performance degraded 10-30% from baseline

**Too High (Overwhelm):**
- Training feels overwhelming
- Can't control heart rate/breathing
- Panic or shut-down response
- Performance degraded >50% from baseline

**Adjustment Approach:**
- Start at 70% of estimated threshold
- Increase 10% each successful session
- If overwhelm occurs, drop back 30%
- Progress slowly - stress tolerance builds over weeks/months
