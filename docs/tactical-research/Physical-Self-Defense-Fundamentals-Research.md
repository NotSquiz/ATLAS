## 1. Foundational Strikes

### 1.1 Palm Heel Strike

The palm heel strike is widely recommended for self-defense over the closed-fist punch for several critical reasons.

**Why Palm Over Punch:**

1. **Reduced injury risk:** When delivering a punch with a closed fist, there is a higher risk of injuring your hand, particularly hitting bony surfaces. A palm strike spreads force across the palm, reducing the risk of fracturing or spraining your fingers or knuckles. There are 27 bones in each hand, many very small and easily broken.

2. **Greater force generation:** One study found palm strikes reached much higher peak forces than fist punches (3600N vs 2000N), with punches impacting twice as long. Palm strikes had approximately twice the concussion rating of fist punches.

3. **Simplicity under stress:** You do not need extensive training to thrust your palm out effectively. It is uncomplicated. If you have your hands up in front of your face, it is easy to launch a palm heel straight ahead.

4. **Better for untrained individuals:** A bad open hand strike is generally more effective than a bad punch, making it a safer default for those without extensive striking practice.

**Technique:**

- The striking surface is the bottom ridge of the palm (heel of the palm) where the forearm bones (radius and ulna) end and the large bones of the hand (metacarpals) begin
- Keep fingers pointing upward or slightly back to protect them from jamming
- Drive through with hip rotation for maximum power
- Aim for soft tissue targets: nose, chin, throat, solar plexus

**Key Consideration:** Most people (especially men) will instinctively punch with their fist. To react instinctively with a palm strike requires training and sparring so that in a real fight you will palm strike without thinking.

### 1.2 Elbow Strikes

"There's a saying in Krav Maga about elbows: 'elbows finish fights.' It's true. Elbows are very powerful short-range combatives and can cause a great deal of damage very quickly."

**Advantages:**

- Elbows are solid bone strikes that can do significant damage
- Quick and hard to see coming at close range
- Less prone to injury than punching
- Can be delivered from almost any position (standing, ground, sitting)

**Mechanics:**

- Use the bones approximately 1 inch in front or behind the actual point of the elbow (depending on striking angle) for maximum power
- Power comes from core rotation and abdominal engagement
- In a horizontal elbow strike, the arm swings parallel to the floor

**Types:**

1. **Horizontal elbow:** Strikes with forearm (to club) or point of elbow (to cut/lacerate)
2. **Downward elbow:** Targets top of head, neck, clavicle
3. **Rear elbow (Elbow #7):** Targets back of head, neck, top of spine where it connects to neck

**Targets:**

- Temple
- Jaw
- Side of neck
- Back of head (if behind opponent)
- Clavicle

### 1.3 Knee Strikes

"No self-respecting self-defense system is complete without knee strikes. Another bone-crushing medium/close-ranged weapon. Your legs are very powerful, and using your hips to back up this strike adds immense impact per square inch."

**Advantages:**

- Legs are the strongest limbs in the body
- Hip drive adds massive power
- Hard to block at close range
- Can be used from clinch position

**Targets:**

- **Groin:** Painful regardless of gender, can temporarily disable
- **Thigh:** Powerful impact is extremely painful, creates avenue of escape
- **Midsection/abdomen:** Always painful
- **Floating ribs:** Easily broken, excellent targets for knees and elbows
- **Face/head:** When opponent is bent over or both on ground

**Technique:**

- Drive the knee upward using hip thrust
- Pull opponent down toward the rising knee when possible (clinch)
- Use abs and core rotation to power the strike

### 1.4 Hammerfist

"The hammerfist strike earns its name because it requires you to imagine that the bottom of your closed fist is the head of a sledgehammer. Hammerfists are incredibly simple and robust; they are the weapon of choice when delivering crushing blows to the hardest parts of your opponent's anatomy."

**Advantages:**

- Dramatically reduces chance of hand injury
- Power generated by body mechanics through shoulder and bent arm
- Simple and robust technique
- Effective against hard targets (skull, jaw)

**Mechanics:**

- Striking surface: fleshy part of the bottom of closed fist
- Power generated by body mechanics, not by straightening the arm
- Hips and shoulders rotating generate the power
- Keep arm bent throughout the strike

**Targets:**

- Collar bone
- Bridge of nose
- Upper lip (centerline)
- Back of head (the "off button" causing unconsciousness)
- Temple
- Jaw

### 1.5 Target Summary

| Strike | Best Range | Primary Targets |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Palm heel | Medium | Nose, chin, throat, solar plexus |
| Elbow | Close/clinch | Temple, jaw, neck, clavicle |
| Knee | Close/clinch | Groin, thigh, ribs, head (bent over) |
| Hammerfist | Close/ground | Skull, temple, back of head, collar bone |

## 2. Defensive Positions

### 2.1 Interview Stance

The "interview" refers to the verbal exchange that often precedes violence. Attackers typically engage in dialogue before physical assault.

**Purpose:**

- Non-threatening posture that prepares for defense
- Maintains reactionary gap (safe distance)
- Allows verbal de-escalation while being ready

**Key Elements:**

- Small, inconspicuous 45-degree stance
- Weight distributed for stability and movement
- Lead hand positioned to maintain distance
- Eyes up, assessing threat
- Body angled to present smaller target

### 2.2 The Fence Technique (Geoff Thompson)

Geoff Thompson coined "the fence" based on experience as a doorman at some of Britain's roughest clubs. He holds 6th Dan black belt in Japanese karate and 1st Dan in Judo.

**What The Fence Is:**

The fence is putting your hands up and out in front of you. The main idea is to establish a safe distance with a neutral, non-threatening posture: hands in front of you, palms open, as if having a normal conversation. Your arms form a subtle "barrier."

**Implementation:**

1. If approached and dialogue starts (the interview), take up a small 45-degree stance
2. Place your lead hand in the space between you and your antagonist to maintain a safe gap
3. Placed correctly, your lead hand and reverse hand block the thoroughfare of the attacker's right and left hand
4. Try not to touch the assailant unless forced to, as contact can trigger aggression

**Options From Fence:**

- Control distance
- Use verbal skills to de-escalate
- If violence escalates, hands are positioned for immediate action
- Can block, trap, strike, or parry from this position

**Pre-Emptive Strike Philosophy:**

Thompson found the pre-emptive attack to be the only consistently effective technique in thousands of live encounters. The key is controlling the pre-fight situation through:
1. Verbal dissuasion
2. Maintaining distance using fence stance
3. Intimidating posturing if needed
4. If violence cannot be avoided, a pre-emptive strike followed immediately by running away

### 2.3 Protecting Vital Areas

**Primary Targets to Protect:**

- Throat and neck (airway, carotid arteries)
- Temple and jaw (knockout zones)
- Groin
- Liver and spleen (ribs)
- Back of head

**Stance Elements:**

- Chin tucked slightly to protect soft targets of face
- Elbows down and tight to protect ribs, spleen, and liver
- Hands up in front
- Eyes up, scanning

### 2.4 Pre-Fight Indicators to Recognize

Recognizing pre-attack indicators can give you critical seconds to prepare or escape.

**Physical Signs of Escalation:**

- Rapid blinking
- Quick, shallow breathing
- Slowed responses during conversation
- Trembling or shaking (muscle twitches, shaky hands, vibrating legs)
- Hyperventilation (deep, quick breaths, chest heaving)
- Muscle tension (tight shoulders, bunched fists, stiff posture)
- Excessive sweating (forehead, palms)

**Facial Cues:**

- **Hard stare:** Prolonged, intense eye contact used to intimidate
- **Thousand-yard stare:** Looking "through" you with unfocused eyes (mentally rehearsing attack)
- Furrowed brows and clenched jaw (tension, growing anger)
- Set jaw (fighting to keep emotions in check)
- Narrowed eyes, predatory grin

**Body Positioning:**

- **Swaying, erratic movement:** Going from calm to suddenly pacing/fidgeting
- **Weight shift:** Preparing to close distance and strike
- **Bladed stance:** Side toward you (fighting stance, aggressive intent)
- **Clenched fists:** Dead giveaway of imminent physical aggression

**Target Scanning:**

- Looking at your chin = thinking about sucker punch "on the button"
- Looking at your crotch = considering opening kick
- Rapid glances at pockets, waistbands = considering weapon access
- Looking at escape routes = planning exit

**The Reactionary Gap:**

The safe distance between you and opponent giving enough time to react. The further from the threat, the safer you are. Being too close reduces reaction time and increases likelihood of being hit, stabbed, grabbed, or taken down.

**How to Respond:**

1. Look for clusters of behavior (two or three signs together demand attention)
2. Create distance: step back, angle body sideways (smaller target)
3. Move toward exits if indoors
4. Trust your "creepy" feeling combined with obvious indicators
5. Act without hesitation: flee, call for help, or prepare to fight

---

## 3. Escapes and Releases

### 3.1 Wrist Grabs

**Core Principle:** Do not fight power with power. The attacker is likely bigger and stronger.

**Technique:**

1. First, brace yourself and establish a good base (less likely to fall)
2. Instead of pulling directly away, rotate your wrist toward the attacker's thumb
3. The thumb is the weakest point in the grip
4. Simultaneously pull back while rotating toward the thumb
5. Use your other hand for assistance if needed

**Key Principles:**

- Axis and leverage (not just pulling)
- Escape toward the thumb or through openings
- Circular movements
- Use other hand for assistance

### 3.2 Bear Hugs

#### From Behind (Rear Bear Hug)

**Method 1: Drop, Thrust, and Escape**

1. Lower yourself toward the ground while spreading your legs
2. Thrust your elbows up to release pressure
3. Grab one of the attacker's hands with your opposite hand
4. Drag opponent onto your back and throw over

**Method 2: Break the Grip**

1. Look down to see which of attacker's hands is on top
2. Insert thumbs behind the wrist of the top hand
3. Walk your hips forward while pushing the arm down
4. The force of hips moving against fingers breaks the grip

**Method 3: Knuckle Strike**

1. Strike hard at attacker's hand with your knuckles
2. If grip does not release, start rubbing hard on top of attacker's hand with knuckles

**Method 4: Hip Drop and Throw (BJJ - Tano Otoshi)**

1. Drop your level
2. Step back
3. Grab opponent's legs behind the knees
4. Take them down

#### From the Front

**Defense Technique:**

1. Put at least one palm heel under the attacker's eyebrow
2. Lower your hips
3. Move hips back away from attacker's hips
4. Push hard against attacker's eyebrow (bends head backward)
5. This forces them to release the grip

**Alternative (Arms Free):**

- Go directly for the eyes with your thumbs
- Dig in as deep as possible
- Very unpleasant sensation forces release

### 3.3 Standing Chokes

**Critical Understanding:** Chokes are potentially lethal. Treat strangulation techniques with the same respect as a knife or gun. Never play around with chokes.

#### Rear Naked Choke (Standing)

**Immediate Response:**

1. When someone wraps the choke, you are immediately in danger
2. Pull down on their arm immediately to alleviate pressure
3. Maintain blood flow to avoid passing out

**Dean Lister's Technique:**

1. Grab as close to attacker's thumb as possible (or wrist)
2. Once you have the grip, widen your base
3. Drop your level
4. Throw opponent over your shoulder
5. Maintain grip on attacker's arm when they hit the ground (sets up arm lock)

**Alternative - Leg Trip:**

1. Exploit attacker's lead leg
2. Hop around it
3. Set up easy trip to take them down

**Additional Methods:**

- Instantly bury chin deeply in crook of attacker's bent elbow (jaw shields throat, carotids, jugular)
- If attacker is too high, pull on their head so they fall off in front
- Slide hands down your head and hook hard on attacker's forearm (preferably wrist), create gap, tuck chin to shoulder

#### Two-Handed Front Choke

**Technique:**

1. Instead of moving backward, bow down in front of them (grip is weakest here)
2. Tense your neck muscles
3. Bow down fast while slipping head to one side

**General Approach: Separate, Stun, Strike**

1. Get attacker's hands separated from throat/neck
2. Quick stunning action
3. Power strike to head area

**Prevention:**

- Being aware of positioning
- Not allowing opponent to take your back is fundamental

### 3.4 Being Grabbed From Behind

**General Principles:**

- React immediately before control is established
- Target vulnerable areas: groin, eyes, throat, instep
- Use elbow strikes (Elbow #7 to back of head/neck)
- Create space then turn to face threat
- Practice regularly for instinctive response

## 4. Ground Survival

### 4.1 Philosophy: Ground Survival vs Ground Fighting

**Critical Distinction:**

In Krav Maga, there is a differentiation between "Ground Fighting" and "Ground Survival."

- **Ground Survival:** Getting back to standing after finding yourself on the ground
- **Ground Fighting:** Incapacitating an assailant to the point they cannot fight anymore

Ground survival has **disengagement as its primary focus** (get up and get away), while ground fighting is not about escape.

**Reality vs Sport BJJ:**

Reality ground fighting differs considerably from combat sports like BJJ:

1. In competition, fights can be won by submission on the ground, incentivizing staying down
2. Sports provide 1600+ square feet of clear mat space (UFC Octagon)
3. Reality ground-fighting occurs in confined, restricted spaces (bars, cars, narrow areas)
4. From Krav Maga perspective, fighting on back seat of a car constitutes ground-fighting

**Self-Defense Jiu-Jitsu Priorities:**

- Going to ground voluntarily exposes you to strikes and additional threats
- Posture, top control, and disengagement over sport positions
- Learning to stand back up safely and escape over staying engaged

**Krav Maga's Approach:**

- Grappling techniques used primarily to get back to feet
- Very little emphasis on ground finishes, joint locks, or strangulation
- Assumes opponents can be armed
- Assumes multiple attackers are possible

### 4.2 Getting Back to Feet: The Technical Stand-Up

"The technical standup is an absolutely essential movement in BJJ. It's used to get back to your feet in self defense."

**Why It Matters:**

Getting knocked down leaves you vulnerable to heavy punches and kicks, particularly to the face and head. This is where many people end up knocked unconscious. Get up off the floor as soon as possible.

**Common Mistake:**

People forget to protect themselves as they get up, leading to knockout.

**Basic Technical Stand-Up:**

1. Post your right hand on the ground behind you
2. Extend your right leg in front of you
3. Use your right leg to kick and keep opponent away
4. Lift your right hip off the floor
5. Bring your right leg behind you by pulling it underneath your body
6. Plant your right foot on the ground behind you
7. Stand up while protecting your face

**Key Points for Stability:**

- Lift hips and turn belly toward floor as you pull leg back
- Do NOT bring feet close together then try to stand (unstable)
- Bring leg all the way back for a wide, stable stance
- In self-defense, cover your head with your free arm while standing

**Variations:**

1. **Full Technical Standup:** Complete movement in one motion
2. **Three-Quarter Technical Standup:** Post on knee first before standing (use when carrying opponent's weight or with flexibility issues)
3. **Half Technical Standup**
4. **Reverse Technical Standup**

### 4.3 Protecting Yourself If Taken Down

**Immediate Priorities:**

1. Protect your head and neck
2. Do not lie flat on your back
3. Get to a position where you can use your legs

**Kick and Scoot Position:**

1. Get on your back with one hand posted behind you
2. Extend legs toward the threat
3. Use your legs as shields to keep attacker at distance
4. Kick at knees, shins, groin to keep attacker away
5. Scoot backward while maintaining leg barrier
6. Create space to perform technical stand-up

**If Being Kicked on the Ground:**

- Cover your head with both arms
- Turn onto your side (not flat on back)
- Bring knees toward chest for protection
- Look for opportunity to grab a leg or sweep
- First safe moment, execute technical stand-up

### 4.4 Basic Guard (Creating Space to Stand)

**Purpose:** Not to win the fight, but to survive long enough to escape.

**Core Concept:**

- Guard exists to control distance and create space
- Use legs to keep attacker from mounting or landing strikes
- Create opening to execute technical stand-up

**Hip Escape (Shrimping):**

- Key element of all ground-based martial arts
- Purpose: eject yourself and escape from underneath an opponent
- Practice until it becomes automatic

**Bridging:**

- Done when your back is to the mat
- Used to escape pins like mount and side control
- Create space to insert leg/knee then escape

### 4.5 Multiple Attacker Awareness

**Critical Reality:**

Ground fighting against multiple attackers is extremely dangerous. Your priority must be getting back to your feet immediately.

**Principles:**

- Never voluntarily go to ground when multiple threats exist
- If taken down, protect head and get up immediately
- Awareness of surroundings is critical
- Getting back to feet allows escape and assessment of threats
- On the ground, you cannot see or defend against additional attackers

## 5. Protection Scenarios

### 5.1 Protecting Spouse/Children

**Planning:**

- Identify areas in home that can be secured in emergency
- Plan escape routes for spouse and children
- Discuss and practice strategy with family
- By planning, preparing, and practicing, you increase family's survival chances

**Family Collaboration During Incidents:**

- Family can help de-escalate situations verbally
- They can assist if situation becomes physical
- They can identify cover, concealment, escape routes, and other threats
- They can communicate regarding other threats and exits

**Training Considerations:**

- Critically examine how having a partner alters your defensive response
- "Partner" could mean spouse, small child, or elderly parent
- Each type imposes different considerations on tactics
- One-handed techniques become important (holding child, moving family member)
- Devote substantial practice to one-handed work if you have small children

**Physical Defense with Family:**

- Use leverage-based techniques for "maximum efficiency with minimal effort"
- Techniques that provide time to escape and call for help
- Priority is creating space for family escape, not winning the fight

### 5.2 Creating Distance and Escape

**Core Philosophy:**

- Avoidance is the first line of defense
- If you can safely escape, do so immediately and contact authorities
- If escape is not possible, retreat to a secure area

**Escape Strategies:**

- Avoid confrontation when possible
- Running away is a valid and often best strategy
- Find hidden location or safe room
- Call for help
- Draw attention to yourself (yell, make noise, cause a scene)

### 5.3 Using Environment (Barriers, Obstacles)

**Environmental Advantages:**

- Put obstacles between you and threat (tables, chairs, cars)
- Use walls for corner protection (prevents attacks from behind)
- Doorways can funnel attackers (deal with one at a time)
- Identify exits before situations escalate

**Home Environment:**

- Know your layout intimately
- Identify choke points
- Have a designated safe room
- Know which doors lock and how quickly

### 5.4 Vehicle as Tool

**Prevention and Awareness:**

- First defense against carjacking is proactive avoidance
- Stay alert, eliminate distractions
- 63% of carjackings occur within 5 miles of home

**High-Risk Locations:**

- Grocery store parking lots (distracted loading groceries, tending children)
- Driveways (false sense of security)
- Gas stations
- ATMs

**Common Criminal Tactics:**

- "Bump and run": Staging minor collision to force you out
- Never get out if someone hits your car from behind in suspicious circumstances
- Distraction approaches while loading vehicle

**Positioning for Escape:**

- Leave sufficient space between you and car in front at stops
- Bumper-to-bumper barricades you in
- Space allows you to turn or escape if threat observed

**Using Your Vehicle:**

- If you can drive away before surrendering, do so
- Even if you must strike other vehicles or objects to escape
- Your vehicle can be a weapon against the carjacker
- Speed makes it harder for attackers to use weapons or gain access
- Never sacrifice your mobility

**During a Carjacking:**

- Statistics show most carjackers prioritize stealing vehicles, not harming occupants
- Compliance can prevent physical harm when no additional threat exists
- Material possessions can be replaced; your life cannot

**Critical Safety Rules:**

- **NEVER go to a second location** - no matter what is threatened, you are more vulnerable there with fewer escape options
- If children are in the car, announce it (carjacker may be too focused to notice)
- Never allow carjacker behind wheel with children inside
- Drawing attention helps: flashers, horn, yelling, causing a scene

**Evasive Driving:**

- High-speed reverse escape if path behind is clear
- Shift quickly to reverse, accelerate 45+ feet (3-4 car lengths)
- Execute J or K turn

## 6. Improvised Tools

### 6.1 Legal Framework in Australia

**Critical Legal Understanding:**

- In Victoria, self-defence is NOT a lawful excuse for carrying a controlled weapon or dangerous article
- In NSW, it is an offence to possess an item in a public place for self-defence purposes
- Self-defence is NOT a valid reason to possess a firearm or prohibited weapon
- Western Australia is the only state where pepper spray can be carried for self-defence (with reasonable grounds)

**The Key Distinction:**

- **Illegal:** Carrying something specifically for self-defence
- **Potentially justifiable:** Using an everyday item you are already carrying legitimately when threatened, if proportionate to the threat

**What You Cannot Do:**

- Carry or possess an article adapted for use as a weapon (unless lawful excuse)
- Carry an article with intention of using it as a weapon

### 6.2 Everyday Objects That Can Be Used

"Improvised weapons are common everyday objects that can be used to defend ourselves with."

**Examples:**

- Pen
- Car keys
- Phone
- Ruler
- Stapler
- Can of food
- Hot cup of coffee
- Salt and pepper shakers
- Calculator
- Umbrella
- Bag/purse (swung)
- Belt
- Book

**Reality Check:**

Nothing prevents using an ordinary day item, like a pen, to protect yourself, as long as it is **reasonable to do so and proportionate** to the attack being experienced.

### 6.3 Flashlights

**Legitimate Use:**

- High-powered tactical flashlights can momentarily impair attacker's vision
- Especially effective in dimly lit environments
- Legal to carry for legitimate purposes (walking at night, etc.)

**As Striking Tool:**

- The hard body can be used as an impact device
- Metal flashlights particularly effective
- Can be held in fist to reinforce strikes

### 6.4 Pens

**Reality vs Myth:**

- "Tactical pens" may draw scrutiny
- Regular pens are ubiquitous and non-threatening in appearance
- Can be used for hammerfist reinforcement or pressure point application
- May require basic training to use effectively

### 6.5 Keys (The Myth)

**The Reality:**

Keys held between fingers (the "Wolverine" method) are largely ineffective and may injure your hand more than the attacker. Better approaches:

- Hold keys in fist for reinforced hammerfist
- Use to reinforce palm heel strike
- Single key held firmly and used to target soft tissue (eye, throat)

### 6.6 What is Actually Effective

**Principles:**

1. Items with weight and durability
2. Items that extend reach safely
3. Items that reinforce natural strikes
4. Items that distract (thrown objects, liquids)

**Most Effective Common Items:**

- Heavy flashlight (reach + impact)
- Umbrella (reach + blocking)
- Fire extinguisher (spray + blunt weapon)
- Chair (barrier + weapon)
- Hot liquid (distraction + deterrent)
- Belt with heavy buckle (reach + impact)

## 7. Training Methodology

### 7.1 How to Practice at Home Safely

**Space Requirements:**

- Enough space to move freely without risking safety
- Clear of low furniture or floor debris
- Full-length mirror helpful but not required

**Solo Training Principles:**

- Start techniques slowly, build speed gradually
- Focus on form before power
- Build muscle memory through constant repetition
- Techniques become instinctive through practice

### 7.2 Solo Drills

**Krav Maga Solo Drills:**

1. **Stance Practice:** The basic Krav Maga stance provides stable platform for attack, defense, and movement. Practice until natural.

2. **Shadow Boxing:** Practice palm heels, elbows, knees, hammerfists in combinations. Move while striking.

3. **Movement Drills:** Practice defensive movement (angles, backing away while protecting face)

4. **Ground Drills:** Technical stand-up, hip escapes (shrimping), bridging

**BJJ Solo Drills:**

1. **Shrimping (Hip Escape):** Fundamental for escaping from underneath
2. **Bridging:** Essential for escaping mounts and pins
3. **Sprawl Drill:** Defend against takedowns, maintain standing position
4. **Breakfalls (Ukemi):** Essential for safely falling without injury

**Key Note:** BJJ Fanatics and Professor John Danaher offer free solo drills series for home training.

### 7.3 Partner Drills

**Safety First:**

- Start slow, increase speed gradually
- Use verbal signals and tap-outs
- Protective gear for striking practice
- Never practice chokes at full pressure

**Essential Partner Drills:**

1. **Fence and Interview Practice:** Practice verbal de-escalation while maintaining fence position
2. **Pre-attack Indicator Recognition:** Partner displays indicators while you practice recognizing and responding
3. **Wrist Grab Releases:** Practice escapes against resistance
4. **Bear Hug Escapes:** Practice all variations (front, rear, arms pinned, arms free)
5. **Technical Stand-Up Against Resistance:** Partner provides increasing resistance
6. **Striking on Pads:** Palm heels, elbows, knees, hammerfists with partner holding pads

### 7.4 When to Seek Professional Instruction

**You Should Seek Professional Training When:**

1. You want to develop reliable, instinctive responses
2. You want to pressure-test techniques against resisting opponents
3. You want proper form correction
4. You want stress inoculation through realistic scenarios
5. You want to learn ground fighting safely

**What Professional Training Provides:**

- Stress drills and scenario-based practice
- Acclimation to adrenaline and chaos of real confrontations
- Sparring experience (critical for timing and distance)
- Correction of dangerous habits
- Progressive skill development

### 7.5 Recommended Systems

**Krav Maga:**

- Israeli self-defense system developed for IDF
- Reality-based, designed for real-world situations
- Rapid learning curve (functional skills in weeks/months)
- Emphasizes gross motor skills (easier under stress)
- Covers defenses against weapons and multiple attackers
- Stress inoculation through scenario training

**Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (Self-Defense Focus):**

- Ground survival and escape skills
- Technical stand-ups and getting back to feet
- Leverage-based (effective regardless of size/strength)
- High-quality sparring develops real skills
- **Note:** Seek "self-defense BJJ" over sport/competition BJJ

**Combination Approach:**

Krav Maga draws on techniques from multiple arts including Muay Thai, kickboxing, BJJ, Karate, wrestling, and boxing. A combination of Krav Maga (striking, weapons defense, scenarios) and BJJ basics (ground survival) provides comprehensive coverage.

**What to Look For in a School:**

- Reality-based training, not sport focus
- Scenario practice
- Stress drills
- Sparring/pressure testing
- Ground survival emphasis (getting up, not submissions)
- Weapons defense training
- Multiple attacker awareness

## 8. Australian Legal Context

### 8.1 Queensland Self-Defense Law Summary

The Criminal Code Act 1899 (Queensland) allows for some use of force if a person is defending themselves, another person, or property.

**Section 271 - Self-Defence Against Unprovoked Assault:**

It is legal to use such force as is reasonably necessary to defend against an unprovoked assault.

**Key Requirements:**

1. Force must be **reasonably necessary**
2. Force must be **proportionate** to the threat faced
3. Force must not be intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm (unless...)

**Exception for Lethal Force:**

If the person being assaulted reasonably fears that their attacker may cause death or grievous bodily harm, that person can use necessary force to defend themselves (or the person being attacked) even if the force causes death of, or grievous bodily harm to, the attacker.

### 8.2 Proportional Response

**The Proportionality Requirement:**

- The force you use must be proportionate to the threat
- Responding to a push by causing serious injury would likely be excessive

**Common Misconception:**

Many believe they can only use force equal to what is being used against them. In reality, the law allows for **reasonable force based on the perceived threat**, which might be more or less than the force used by the attacker.

### 8.3 What is Reasonable

**Heat of the Moment Consideration:**

The courts do not expect a person defending himself, who has to react instantly to danger, to "weigh precisely the exact measure of self-defensive action which is required."

While force must be reasonable, courts make allowance for:
- Acting in the heat of the moment
- Highly stressful circumstances
- Little time to carefully weigh reasonableness

### 8.4 Pre-Emptive Force

**Key Distinction in Queensland:**

Queensland's Criminal Code (Sections 271-272) provides broad self-defence rights, including against unprovoked assaults. A key distinction is the **recognition of pre-emptive force**: you may act before being attacked if the threat is imminent.

### 8.5 Duty to Retreat

**Queensland Position:**

Unlike some other countries, Queensland does NOT have explicit "stand your ground" laws.

**However:**

- You are NOT legally required to retreat
- Your ability to safely leave a situation **may be considered** when evaluating self-defence claims
- No explicit duty to retreat, but retreat option is a factor

### 8.6 Burden of Proof

**Reverse Onus:**

Once the defence of self-defence has been raised:
- The **prosecution** bears the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was NOT acting in self-defence
- The **defence** does NOT have to prove the accused was acting in self-defence
- If prosecution cannot exclude the possibility of self-defence, the accused will be acquitted

### 8.7 Unique Queensland Features

Queensland is the **only Australian jurisdiction** to distinguish between self-defence against unprovoked and provoked assaults.

### 8.8 Practical Guidelines

**To Support a Self-Defense Claim:**
