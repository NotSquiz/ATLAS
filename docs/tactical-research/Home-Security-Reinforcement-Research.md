## 1. Door and Entry Reinforcement

### Deadbolt Lock Grades (ANSI/BHMA Standards)

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA) rate locks based on security, durability, and finish.

| Grade | Classification | Cycle Test | Best Use |
|-------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Grade 1** | Commercial/High Security | 250,000 cycles, 800 lb-ft torque resistance | Recommended for all exterior doors |
| **Grade 2** | Light Commercial/Best Residential | Lower cycle requirements | Acceptable for residential use |
| **Grade 3** | Basic Residential | Entry-level requirements | Interior doors only |

**Key Specifications for Grade 1 Deadbolts:**
- Bolt strength: Holds at least 350 lb-f side load
- Bolt impact: Survives 2 blows at 148 ft-lb (~200 J)
- Bolt saw resistance: Resists sawing for at least 5 minutes at 5 lb-f
- Lever strength: All grades must withstand 360 pounds applied force

**Recommendations:**
- Install Grade 1 deadbolts on all exterior doors
- Pair with Grade 2/3 knob sets to save costs while maintaining security
- The deadbolt provides primary security; the knob set handles convenience
- Look for BHMA "AAA" rating (security, durability, finish) for best overall quality

**Insurance Note:** Installing ANSI/BHMA certified deadbolts can reduce insurance premiums. Many insurers require Grade 2 or higher deadbolts on all exterior doors. Failure to use properly graded locks could affect claim outcomes if a break-in occurs without forcible entry evidence.

### Hinge Security

**Why It Matters:** A 2023 study by the National Burglary Prevention Association found 58% of forced entry attempts target door hinges. Doors with exposed hinges (outward-swinging) allow intruders to tap hinge pins out and lift the door off without unlocking it.

#### Security Options:

1. **Security Studs (Safety Studs)**
   - Small metal peg installed in one hinge leaf that fits into corresponding hole when door is closed
   - Even if hinge pin is removed, the stud holds the door in place
   - Can purchase hinges with studs pre-installed or retrofit existing hinges
   - Essential for exterior doors that open outward

2. **Non-Removable Pin (NRP) Hinges**
   - Use a screw to secure the pin; not accessible when door is closed
   - Pin can only be removed with door open
   - Best option for new installations

3. **Setscrew Hinges**
   - Small screw threaded through middle of hinge into the pin
   - DIY option: Drill hole through hinge middle into pin, install small setscrew
   - Important: Grind down setscrew head to prevent removal

4. **Fast-Riveted (Crimped) Pins**
   - Pins longer than hinge height, crimped/bent to create rivet
   - Most secure option available
   - Trade-off: Makes legitimate door removal difficult

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Replace existing hinge screws with 2-4 inch security screws that anchor into door frame studs
- Drill pilot holes slightly smaller than screw diameter to prevent wood splitting
- Consider Hingemate door hinge security pins (kit includes three pins with installation instructions)

---

### Strike Plate Upgrades

Standard strike plates are secured with short screws into the door frame only, not the structural studs. This creates a significant weak point.

**Upgrade Options:**
- Replace short screws with 3-inch screws that reach structural studs
- Install extended strike plates (4-6 inches vs standard 1-2 inches)
- StrikeMaster II Pro addresses this with 48-inch reinforcement

**Key Principle:** The strike plate area is where the deadbolt engages; if this fails, the lock is irrelevant.

---

### Smart Lock Security Considerations

**Recent Vulnerabilities (2025 Research):**
Security researchers discovered critical vulnerabilities in Master Lock Vault Enterprise system:
- Replay attacks allowing unauthenticated unlocking
- Former guests continuing to unlock after access expiration
- Malicious users extending temporary access arbitrarily
- Ability to forge audit events
- Denial of Service attacks via malformed BLE messages
- One attack allowed lock access up to 9 months after access was revoked

**Common Vulnerability Categories:**

1. **Wireless Communication Risks**
   - Bluetooth/Wi-Fi susceptible to jamming or signal interception
   - Some encryption keys are hardcoded in apps (e.g., August Smart Lock Pro)
   - Potential for Wi-Fi password interception

2. **Software/Design Flaws**
   - U.S. government warned about Chirp Systems app flaw allowing remote unauthorized access
   - Network dependencies mean compromised Wi-Fi compromises smart locks

3. **Physical Vulnerabilities**
   - Many smart locks still use standard lock mechanisms vulnerable to picking/bumping
   - Battery failure can create access issues

**Best Practices:**
- Regularly update firmware
- Choose reputable manufacturers with track record of addressing security flaws
- Use strong, unique passwords (not defaults)
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Use WPA3 encryption on Wi-Fi network
- Consider separate network for smart devices
- Look for ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 mechanical rating (250,000 cycles, 800 lb-ft torque resistance)

**Insurance Considerations:** Some policies specify certain lock types/standards. Smart lock malfunctions or hacking may affect coverage.

### Security Screens (Australian Market)

Security screens are particularly popular in Australia due to climate (allowing airflow while maintaining security) and local manufacturing.

#### Comparison: Crimsafe vs Amplimesh vs Invisi-Gard

| Feature | Crimsafe | Amplimesh SupaScreen | Invisi-Gard |
|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Mesh Material** | 304 grade 0.9mm hi-tensile stainless steel | 316 marine grade 0.8mm stainless steel | Varies |
| **Mesh Thickness** | 26.5% thicker than competitors (Tensile-Tuff) | Standard | Standard |
| **Attachment** | Screw-Clamp technology with tamper-resistant screws | Pressure fit (clips without screws) | Varies |
| **Impact Rating** | Tested to 500 joules (UNSW ADFA) | Tested to 2,300+ joules | Varies |
| **Warranty** | 10 years (extendable to 12) | 16 years (SupaScreen), 10 years (IntrudaGuard) | Varies |
| **Corrosion** | 304 grade - same as kitchen sink/cutlery | 316 marine grade - gold standard | Varies |
| **Aesthetics** | May have visible screws (covers available) | No visible screws or rivets | Clean appearance |
| **Price Range** | $1,000-$1,500+ per door | $950-$1,400 per door | Comparable |

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Coastal Properties:** Amplimesh's 316 marine-grade steel offers superior corrosion resistance near saltwater

2. **Lock Quality:** Security screens are only as strong as their weakest component
   - Must have triple lock to comply with Australian Standards for "security door" classification
   - Single lock = "safety door" or "barrier door" only
   - All major brands include triple locks, fixed-pin security hinges, screen door closers

3. **Experience:** Amplimesh has 50+ years in Australian market; Crimsafe has 30+ years

**Important:** Get multiple quotes and ensure installation by authorized dealers for warranty validity.

### Window Locks and Pins

**Standard Upgrades:**
- Key-operated window locks (replace basic latches)
- Window pins (prevent sliding windows from opening more than a few inches)
- Sash jammers for double-hung windows
- Reinforced window latches

**Best Practice:** Combine contact sensors (detect opening) with glass break sensors (detect breaking).

---

### Glass Break Sensors

#### Types:

1. **Acoustic Sensors**
   - Small microphones listening for specific frequencies of breaking glass
   - Can detect glass breaking from up to 20 feet away
   - Single sensor can cover entire room (multiple windows)
   - Placement: Mount on wall/ceiling with clear "line of hearing" to windows
   - Limitation: Heavy curtains/blinds can muffle sound - place sensor closer

2. **Shock/Vibration Sensors**
   - Attached directly to glass surface
   - "Feel" for vibrations rather than sound
   - Can detect issues before glass breaks completely
   - Less prone to false alarms than acoustic
   - Limitation: Protects only one surface at a time

#### Placement Guidelines:
- Focus on ground floor and basement windows (easiest access points)
- Include glass doors (french doors, sliding glass, decorative front door glass)
- At least one acoustic sensor per vulnerable room
- For shock sensors, mount on each window individually
- Acoustic sensors: Within 20 feet of glass, closer if heavy curtains present

#### Advantages Over Motion Detectors:
Motion detectors alert you when intruder is already inside. Glass break sensors alert you at moment of entry attempt, providing earlier warning.

**Best Practice:** Use both contact sensors AND glass break sensors for comprehensive protection.

## 3. Perimeter and Detection

### Lighting Strategies

#### Motion-Activated Lighting

**Installation Height:** 6-10 feet above ground for optimal sensor detection and light spread

**Strategic Locations:**
- All entry points (doors, gates)
- Driveways
- Dark corners vulnerable to concealment
- Pathways to doors
- Garage area

**Sensor Adjustment Tips:**
- Angle sensor slightly downward (focuses on people, not distant objects)
- For doors: Cover the immediate approach
- For driveways: Follow natural path of vehicles/people
- Too high = may miss movement
- Too low = false triggers from cars, animals

**Reducing False Alarms:**
- PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors detect heat changes
- Dual-tech sensors (PIR + microwave) only trigger when both confirm motion
- PIR sensors most sensitive to motion ACROSS the sensor, not toward/away
- Adjust sensitivity settings for your environment

**Integration with Cameras:**
- Motion lights dramatically improve camera footage quality
- Position cameras to avoid pointing into light sources (prevents glare)
- Infrared cameras work better with supplemental LED lighting (provides color night vision)

**Sources:**
- [LED Motion Detector Placement Guide](https://www.ledlightexpert.com/outdoor-motion-detector-light-placement-security-and-safety-zones)
- [PacLights Motion Sensor Best Practices](https://www.paclights.com/explore/security-lights-with-motion-sensor-best-practices-for-implementing-in-lighting-design/)

---

### Camera Placement Best Practices

**Priority Locations:**
1. Front door (main entry point)
2. Back door
3. First-floor and basement windows
4. Driveway
5. Garage
6. Front and back yards (early warning system)
7. Porches and sheds

**Height and Positioning:**
- Mount 8-10 feet off ground for optimal coverage
- Corner mounting at 45-degree angle provides up to 180-degree coverage
- Point cameras away from sun (facing north or under eaves)
- Avoid pointing directly at light sources

**Camera Types:**
- Outdoor cameras with motion-activated lighting serve as deterrent AND detection
- Infrared for night vision (improved with supplemental lighting)
- Wide-angle lenses for maximum coverage
- Consider both visible (deterrent) and discreet (evidence) placement

- [Security.org Placement Guide](https://www.security.org/security-cameras/placement-guide/)
- [StaySafe.org Camera Coverage Guide](https://staysafe.org/home-safety/home-security-camera-placement/)

---

### Sensor Types and Placement

**PIR (Passive Infrared) Sensors:**
- Most common type
- Detect heat signature changes
- Energy efficient and reliable
- Most sensitive to motion across the sensor field

**Dual-Technology Sensors:**
- Combine PIR with microwave detection
- Both must trigger for alarm
- Reduces false alarms significantly
- Better for challenging environments

**Placement Principles:**
- Cover all entry points
- Consider "desire lines" (natural paths people take)
- Avoid HVAC vents (can trigger PIR sensors)
- Account for pet movement if applicable (pet-immune sensors available)

---

### Alarm System Considerations

#### Monitored vs Unmonitored Systems

| Aspect | Monitored | Unmonitored/Self-Monitored |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Response** | 24/7 professional operators contact police/owner | Owner receives notification, must respond personally |
| **Cost** | $15-60/month ongoing + equipment | Equipment only (one-time) |
| **Police Response** | Monitoring centre contacts authorities | Owner must call themselves |
| **System Monitoring** | Staff alerted to equipment malfunctions | Owner must inspect regularly |
| **Insurance** | Often qualifies for premium discounts | May qualify for smaller discounts |
| **Best For** | Higher-risk properties, frequent travel, maximum peace of mind | Budget-conscious, low-risk areas, tech-savvy owners |

**Australian Market Costs:**
- Professional alarm system: $600-$2,500 (installation)
- Average: $2,000-$2,500
- Monitoring: $15-60/month ongoing

**Key Decision Factors:**
- Some insurance policies require central monitoring for high-value properties ($1M+)
- Unmonitored systems rely entirely on owner availability
- Self-monitoring via smartphone provides middle ground
- Consider: "If I can't respond immediately, what happens?"

---

### Queensland Regulations

**Key Points:**
- Check local council requirements for CCTV placement (privacy considerations)
- Alarm systems must comply with Australian Standards
- Security screen doors must meet AS 5039 for "security door" classification
- Professional installers should hold appropriate Queensland licenses

**Queensland Police Resources:**
- Free home security assessments available (see Section 6)
- QPS Home Security Guide available online
- District Crime Prevention Units provide advice

---

## 4. Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)

CPTED is a multidisciplinary approach to reducing crime by shaping the built and natural environment. Research on the Gold Coast found strong association between high CPTED scores and low crime rates.

### The Four Core Principles

#### 1. Natural Surveillance
**Principle:** Ensure public and semi-public areas are easily observed by legitimate users.

**Residential Applications:**
- Clear sightlines from inside house to street and yard
- Appropriate lighting at all entry points
- Windows positioned to observe approach paths
- Trim vegetation that blocks views of doors/windows
- Avoid tall hedges near entry points that create concealment

**Key Question:** "Can I see someone approaching before they reach my door?"

---

#### 2. Access Control
**Principle:** Restrict, channel, and encourage people into appropriate areas.

**Residential Applications:**
- Clear, defined pathways to main entrance
- Symbolic barriers (low fences, garden borders) define private space
- Physical barriers (fencing, locked gates) for high-security areas
- Single obvious entry point for visitors
- Side gates locked and not easily visible from street

**Key Question:** "Does my property clearly communicate where visitors should go?"

---

#### 3. Territorial Reinforcement
**Principle:** Use boundary markers and environmental cues to communicate ownership.

**Residential Applications:**
- Visible house numbers
- Well-maintained gardens and fencing
- Personalization of space (signals active ownership)
- Clear boundaries between public footpath and private property
- Transition zones that signal "moving from public to private space"

**Research Finding:** When people feel sense of ownership/responsibility, crime decreases. The goal is to make it clear where "out of bounds" begins before reaching the entrance.

**Key Question:** "Does my property look actively cared for and occupied?"

---

#### 4. Space Management/Maintenance
**Principle:** Well-maintained spaces signal active ownership and discourage crime.

**Residential Applications:**
- Regular lawn mowing and garden maintenance
- Prompt repair of broken fences, lights, locks
- No accumulation of mail/newspapers when away
- Clean, well-lit exterior
- No abandoned vehicles or equipment visible

**Principle:** Neglected appearance signals opportunity to criminals.

**Key Question:** "Does my property look like someone is paying attention?"

---

### Landscaping for Security

#### Thorny Plants as Natural Barriers

Thorny bushes deter intruders, can snag skin/clothing (providing evidence), and create psychological barriers.

**Effective Security Plants (Australia-appropriate):**

| Plant | Characteristics | Best Use |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Bougainvillea** | Thorny, dense, grows to 40 feet, climbing | Walls, fences, drainpipes, pergolas |
| **Pyracantha (Firethorn)** | Dense evergreen, sharp thorns | Under windows, along fences |
| **Roses (climbing varieties)** | Classic thorny plant | Under windows, fence lines |
| **Holly** | Fast-growing, spiny leaves | Hedges, under windows |
| **Hawthorn** | Dense, thorny shrub | Perimeter hedging |

**Strategic Placement:**
- First-floor windows (primary entry point for burglars)
- Along fences/walls to prevent climbing
- Property perimeter as first barrier
- Multiple layers: tall plants at boundary, medium shrubs, low thorny groundcover near house

**Important Considerations:**
- Keep plants trimmed so they don't obstruct views (CPTED natural surveillance)
- Consider fire safety (don't block emergency exits)
- Don't create hiding spots near doors/windows
- Regular maintenance required

## 5. Safe Room Basics (Queensland Cyclone Shelter Context)

Queensland's cyclone building codes provide a legitimate framework for understanding reinforced room construction.

### Queensland Building Context

**Regulatory Framework:**
- Queensland Development Code MP 3.8 (Public Cyclone Shelters) - effective May 2023
- Homes within 50km of coastline north of Bundaberg designed for cyclonic winds
- Design standard: Wind pressures consistent with mid-strength Category 4 cyclone (~250km/hr gusts)
- Homes built to current codes performed well in TC Larry (2006), Yasi (2011), Debbie (2017)
- Pre-1985 homes generally sustain more damage

### Residential Strong Room Considerations

**Purpose:** Keep family safe during severe tropical cyclone (also provides security benefits)

**Cost:** Approximately 3-6% of new home construction cost

**Construction Specifications (from QLD Places of Refuge Guidelines):**
- External cladding with moderate debris resistance equivalent to:
  - 110mm double brick
  - Core-filled 200 series block
  - 19mm hardwood plywood cladding
- Single skin walls (fibre cement, thin metal) NOT acceptable
- Continuous metal roofing, screw-fixed (not terracotta/concrete tile)
- No secret-fixed (clipped) metal cladding

**General Recommendations:**
- Small room with few windows (bathroom often used during cyclones)
- Consider water intrusion (some water likely during cyclone)
- Ventilation considerations (may get stuffy if crowded)

---

### Communication Provisions

**Essential:**
- Charged mobile phone with emergency contacts
- Battery-powered or hand-crank radio (ABC local radio for emergencies)
- Power bank for device charging
- List of emergency numbers

**Recommended:**
- UHF radio (if phone networks overloaded)
- Whistle for signaling
- Torch with spare batteries

---

### Basic Supplies

**Emergency Kit Essentials:**
- Water (minimum 3 litres per person per day)
- Non-perishable food
- First aid kit
- Medications
- Important documents (copies in waterproof container)
- Cash
- Torch and batteries
- Battery-powered radio
- Phone charger/power bank

**Queensland-Specific:**
- Cyclone kit should be prepared before cyclone season (November-April)
- Check and refresh supplies annually

---

### Important Notes

- Strong rooms/shelters do NOT replace the need to evacuate when directed
- Always follow Queensland Emergency Services directives
- If in a cyclone-prone area, have an evacuation plan ready
- Check QLD Fire and Emergency Services for current advice

### Insurance Considerations for Security Upgrades

**Potential Premium Discounts:**
- Up to 5% for basic security (deadbolts, smoke detectors, burglar alarms)
- Up to 10-20% for comprehensive monitored security systems
- Some insurers offer additional discounts for smart home security integration

**Requirements for Discounts:**
- Deadbolts on ALL exterior doors (not just front door)
- Monitored alarm systems typically qualify for larger discounts than unmonitored
- May need to provide proof of installation (contract, certificate from security company)
- High-value properties ($1M+) may require central monitoring for any discount

**Insurance Claim Considerations:**
- Failure to use properly graded locks could affect claims
- Smart lock malfunctions may be investigated as potential negligence
- Document all security upgrades for insurance records

**Stacking Discounts:**
Many insurers allow combining discounts:
- Fire safety (smoke detectors)
- Security (alarms, locks)
- Mitigation (weatherproofing)
Combined discounts may exceed sum of individual discounts.

**Recommendation:**
- Contact your insurer BEFORE making upgrades to understand what qualifies
- Get upgrades documented with receipts
- Update your policy to reflect improvements
- Australian insurers to contact: NRMA, Allianz, RACV, Suncorp, etc.
