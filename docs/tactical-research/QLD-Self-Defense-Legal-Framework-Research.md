## 1. Legislative Framework

### 1.1 Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) - Self-Defence Provisions

Queensland is **unique** among Australian jurisdictions in distinguishing between self-defence against **unprovoked** and **provoked** assaults. This distinction is critical to understanding your rights.

#### Section 271 - Self-Defence Against Unprovoked Assault

**Full Text Summary:**

When a person is **unlawfully assaulted** and has **not provoked** the assault, it is lawful for them to use:

1. **Non-lethal force:** Such force as is reasonably necessary to make effectual defence against the assault, provided:
   - The force is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm (GBH)
   - The force is not likely to cause death or GBH

2. **Lethal force (elevated threshold):** Any force necessary for defence, even if it may cause death or GBH, **if**:
   - The nature of the assault causes **reasonable apprehension** of death or GBH
   - The person **believes on reasonable grounds** they cannot otherwise preserve themselves from death or GBH

**Key Points:**
- No duty to retreat required for unprovoked assaults
- The test combines **subjective belief** (what the person believed) with **objective reasonableness** (were there reasonable grounds for that belief)

**Citation:** [Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) s 271](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s271.html)

---

#### Section 272 - Self-Defence Against Provoked Assault

**Where the defendant provoked the assault:**

If a person assaults someone or provokes an assault, section 272 permits them to use reasonable force (even if it results in death or GBH) to protect themselves **only if**:

1. The other person responded with **such violence** that the person who provoked fears death or GBH
2. The person believed they could not otherwise be preserved from death or GBH
3. **Critical requirement:** The person must have **"declined further conflict, and quitted it or retreated from it as far as was practicable"** before the necessity arose

**Key Distinction:**
- For **provoked** assaults: Duty to retreat **does** apply
- For **unprovoked** assaults: No duty to retreat

**Citation:** [Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) s 272](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s272.html)

---

#### Section 273 - Aiding in Self-Defence (Defence of Others)

**Full Text:**

> "In any case in which it is lawful for any person to use force of any degree for the purpose of defending himself or herself against an assault, it is lawful for any other person acting in **good faith** in the first person's aid to use a **like degree of force** for the purpose of defending the first person."

**Practical Application:**
- You can defend your family (spouse, children) or even strangers
- Your use of force is tied to what the person being defended could lawfully use
- You must act in "good faith" - genuinely believing you are helping

**Citation:** [Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) s 273](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s273.html)

---

#### Section 267 - Defence of Dwelling

**This is Queensland's primary "castle doctrine" equivalent and is BROADER than general self-defence.**

**When Section 267 Applies:**

It is lawful for a person in **peaceable possession** of a dwelling, and any person lawfully assisting them, to use force to **prevent or repel** another person from unlawfully entering or remaining in the dwelling, **if**:

1. The person believes on **reasonable grounds** that the other person is attempting to enter or remain in the dwelling
2. With **intent to commit an indictable offence** in the dwelling
3. And the person believes it is **necessary** to use that force

**Critical Features (Different from General Self-Defence):**

| Feature | General Self-Defence (s 271) | Defence of Dwelling (s 267) |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Proportionality required | Yes | **No** |
| Reasonable force required | Yes | **No** - only "necessary" |
| Can cause death/GBH | Only if fear death/GBH | **Yes** - without that fear |
| Must fear for life | Yes (for lethal force) | **No** |

**The Key Advantage:**
Unlike self-defence, section 267 does **not** require the force to be proportionate. Courts have held that "section 267 might apply even if the defendant used more force than was reasonably necessary." The absence of proportionality reflects that "an occupant faced with a sudden home invasion cannot be expected to exercise fine judgment as to the exact level of force required."

**What Constitutes a "Dwelling":**
Courts have adopted an **inclusive approach**, recognizing:
- Houses and units
- Sheds (when residential in nature)
- Tents
- Carports (attached)
- Caravans
- Motel rooms

**What Does NOT Qualify:**
- Open land around the dwelling
- Detached structures not connected to the dwelling
- Concrete slabs or pathways between structures (see bow and arrow case in Section 7)

**Citation:** [Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) s 267](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s267.html)

---

#### Section 268 - Provocation

Section 268 defines **provocation** as:

> "Any wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be likely, when done to an ordinary person, or to people in a special relationship to the person, to deprive the person of the power of self-control, and to induce the person to assault the person by whom the act or insult is done or offered."

**Note:** A **lawful act** is not provocation for an assault. Threatening violence has been held sufficient to form a reasonable belief for purposes of defence.

---

#### Section 274 - Defence of Moveable Property Against Trespassers

**Full Text Summary:**

It is lawful for any person in **peaceable possession** of moveable property to use:
- Such force as is **reasonably necessary** to:
  - Resist the taking of the property by a trespasser
  - Retake it from a trespasser

**Limitation:** The person must **not do grievous bodily harm** to the trespasser.

**Citation:** [Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) s 274](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s274.html)

---

#### Section 277 - Defence of Premises Against Trespassers / Removal of Disorderly Persons

**Full Text Summary:**

It is lawful for a person in peaceable possession of any **land, structure, vessel, or place**, or entitled to its control/management, to use:
- Such force as is **reasonably necessary** to:
  - Prevent any person from **wrongfully entering**
  - **Remove** a person who wrongfully remains
  - Remove any person who **conducts himself disorderly**

**Limitation:** Must **not do grievous bodily harm** to such person.

**Practical Application:**
- You can push a trespasser off your land
- You **cannot** "clobber him with a weapon" unless the situation escalates to self-defence
- Different from s 267 which allows any necessary force inside the dwelling

**Citation:** [Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) s 277](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/qld/consol_act/cc189994/s277.html)

---

## 2. Key Legal Concepts

### 2.1 "Reasonable Force"

The concept of "reasonable force" requires considering:
- The nature of the threat
- Whether the force was proportionate to the threat
- Whether the person believed the force was necessary
- Whether there were reasonable grounds for that belief

**Courts recognise:** If a person acts in self-defence "in the heat of the moment when they are fearful of being hurt or killed, they are not expected to 'weigh their response on a knife's edge' to determine the exact level of force that is reasonable."

However, defensive conduct **must not be out of all proportion** to the threat faced.

---

### 2.2 Proportionality Principle

**General Self-Defence:** Proportionality is embedded in the "reasonableness" assessment.

**Defence of Dwelling (s 267):** Proportionality is **NOT** a separate requirement. This is a deliberate policy choice recognizing the impossibility of fine-tuned judgment during a home invasion.

---

### 2.3 Imminent Threat Requirement

Discussions about self-defence raise concepts of "proportionality" and "imminence." However:
- These are **not separate requirements** under existing Queensland law
- Proportionality forms part of the **reasonableness** consideration
- Imminence is tied to the **necessity** to defend against an unlawful assault

**Practical meaning:** You cannot use force against a future or past threat - only against one that is occurring or about to occur.

---

### 2.4 Duty to Retreat

**Summary Table:**

| Situation | Duty to Retreat? |
|-----------|------------------|
| Unprovoked assault (s 271) | **No** |
| Provoked assault (s 272) | **Yes** - must retreat "as far as practicable" |
| Defence of dwelling (s 267) | **No** - no requirement to flee your own home |
| Defence of land/property (s 277) | Not explicit, but failure to retreat may affect "reasonableness" |

**Key principle:** Queensland law recognizes that a person defending their home is not required to retreat from a threat, even where retreat might otherwise appear a reasonable option.

---

### 2.5 Castle Doctrine Equivalent (Section 267)

**Similarities to US Castle Doctrine:**
- Special protection for your dwelling
- No duty to retreat inside your home
- Greater latitude for force used

**Differences from US Castle Doctrine:**
- Must believe intruder intends to commit an **indictable offence** (not just unlawful entry)
- Still requires reasonable belief (not automatic permission)
- Does not extend to your entire property - only the dwelling itself

**Important:** The 2024 Castle Law Amendment Bill sought to expand these protections but had not passed as of this writing. Monitor legislative updates.

---

### 2.6 The Zecevic Test (High Court Authority)

**Zecevic v Director of Public Prosecutions (1987) 162 CLR 645** is the leading High Court authority on self-defence.

**The Test:**
> "The question to be asked in the end is quite simple. It is whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did."

**Elements:**
1. **Subjective:** Did the accused genuinely believe it was necessary?
2. **Objective:** Were there reasonable grounds for that belief?

**Burden of Proof:**
- The prosecution must **negative** self-defence beyond reasonable doubt
- The defence does **not** have to prove self-defence
- If the jury is left in reasonable doubt, the accused is entitled to acquittal

---

## 3. Home Defence Scenarios

### 3.1 Intruder in Home at Night

**Legal Position:**

Under **Section 267**, if you are in peaceable possession of your dwelling and:
- You believe on reasonable grounds an intruder is attempting to enter
- You believe they intend to commit an indictable offence (burglary, assault, etc.)
- You believe force is necessary to prevent this

**You may use whatever force is necessary** - including force that may cause death or GBH - without the usual proportionality requirements.

**Practical Considerations:**
- Night-time entry typically supports a reasonable belief of criminal intent
- Arm yourself only if genuinely necessary
- Verbal warnings ("I've called the police, leave now!") strengthen your position
- Remain inside if possible - leaving to confront weakens your defence

---

### 3.2 Intruder Threatening Family

**Section 267 + Section 273:**

You can defend family members under section 273 "aiding in self-defence" using the same degree of force they could use themselves. Combined with section 267's dwelling protection, this provides strong legal grounds for defensive action.

**Key factors:**
- Visible threat to family strengthens "reasonable belief"
- Your belief that force is necessary to protect them
- Acting in "good faith" to aid their defence

---

### 3.3 Confronting Trespasser Outside Home

**Critical Legal Distinction:**

| Location | Applicable Law | Force Permitted |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Inside dwelling | Section 267 | Necessary force (including lethal) |
| Yard/land (within property) | Section 277 | Reasonable force, no GBH |
| Outside property | General self-defence only | If assaulted |

**Warning:** Leaving your home to confront an intruder **significantly increases legal risk**.

In Queensland cases where homeowners were found guilty, a common factor was that **the occupier left the home to confront the deceased**. This shifts you from the protective umbrella of s 267 to the more restrictive s 277 or general self-defence.

**Best Practice:**
- Stay inside your dwelling
- Call police
- Only engage if the intruder attempts to enter

---

### 3.4 What Constitutes "Dwelling"

**Courts have included:**
- Residential houses
- Units/apartments
- Sheds (when attached or residential in character)
- Carports (attached to dwelling)
- Caravans and mobile homes
- Motel/hotel rooms
- Tents (in residential context)

**Courts have excluded:**
- Open land surrounding the dwelling
- Detached sheds not connected to the house
- Pathways, driveways, concrete slabs between structures
- Garages that are clearly separate from living areas

**The bow and arrow case (see Section 7)** established that a concrete slab linking a house to a shed was **not** part of the dwelling.

---

### 3.5 Hot Pursuit Limitations

**Critical Warning:** Queensland law provides **NO** broad protection for pursuing a trespasser who has left your property.

**Legal Position:**
- Section 267 applies to preventing entry or removing someone **from** the dwelling
- Section 277 applies to your land but with GBH restrictions
- Once the intruder has fled, the immediate threat has ended
- Pursuing them likely converts you from defender to aggressor

**If they've stolen property:**
- You may have citizen's arrest powers (see below) but these are limited
- Call police - pursuing is legally and physically risky
- Document their description, vehicle, direction of travel

---

## 4. Vehicle Defence

### 4.1 Carjacking Response

**Legal Framework:**

There is no specific "carjacking defence" provision. Standard self-defence principles apply:

1. **If threatened in your vehicle:** General self-defence (s 271/272) applies
2. **Your vehicle is your property:** Section 274 allows reasonable force to resist taking of moveable property (but no GBH)
3. **If they threaten violence:** Elevated self-defence thresholds may apply

**Practical Guidance:**
- **Compliance is often safest** - cars are replaceable, you are not
- If you choose to defend, the reasonableness of your response will be assessed
- Using the vehicle to escape is generally more defensible than using it to attack

---

### 4.2 Using Vehicle to Escape/Defend

**Escaping:**
Using your vehicle to flee an attack is generally the **most defensible** action:
- Demonstrates you're not the aggressor
- Shows you attempted to avoid conflict
- Minimises harm

**Ramming Attackers:**

Using your vehicle as a weapon is **extremely high-risk legally**:
- Vehicles are lethal force
- Must satisfy the elevated threshold (reasonable fear of death/GBH)
- Prosecution will scrutinize whether you could have simply driven away
- Could result in murder/manslaughter charges if the force is deemed excessive

**When Might Ramming Be Defensible:**
- You're boxed in and cannot escape
- Multiple armed attackers
- They're actively trying to access your vehicle to harm you
- Reasonable belief that stopping or remaining stationary will result in death/GBH

---

## 5. Weapons and Tools

### 5.1 Weapons Act 1990 (Qld) - Overview

The Weapons Act 1990 regulates possession and use of weapons in Queensland. Key principles:

- **Licensing required** for firearms, certain knives, crossbows, paintball guns
- **Prohibited weapons** cannot be possessed without special authority
- **Self-defence is NOT a valid reason** for obtaining any weapons licence
- Maximum penalties range from **2 years to 13 years imprisonment**

**Citation:** [Weapons Act 1990 (Qld)](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-1990-071)

---

### 5.2 Pepper Spray / Capsicum Spray / OC Spray

**Legal Status: PROHIBITED**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Classification | Classified as a **firearm** under Schedule 2, Weapons Act 1990 |
| Possession | Requires **Category R weapons licence** |
| Genuine reason | Must demonstrate genuine reason (self-defence is NOT valid) |
| Maximum penalty | **7 years imprisonment** or 300 penalty units (s 50(1)) |
| Acquisition without permit | **2 years imprisonment** or 100 penalty units (s 35) |

**Who Can Legally Possess:**
- Police officers
- Certain security personnel (with appropriate licence)
- Persons with valid Category R licence and approved genuine reason

**For civilians:** Possession is effectively **illegal** as self-defence is not an approved reason.

---

### 5.3 Tasers / Stun Guns / Electric Shock Devices

**Legal Status: CONTROLLED/PROHIBITED**

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Classification | Controlled weapon requiring Category R licence |
| Civilian possession | Generally **prohibited** for personal protection |
| Police use | Only patrol officers and SERT (Special Emergency Response Team) |
| Maximum penalty | Up to **7 years imprisonment** or fines up to $13,800 |

**Even security guards** must have specific licensing and justification.

---

### 5.4 Knife Laws

**Weapons Act 1990 (Qld) Section 51:**

> "A person must not physically possess a knife in a public place or a school, unless the person has a reasonable excuse."

**Critical Point:** Self-defence is **NOT** a reasonable excuse for carrying a knife.

**Reasonable excuses include:**
- Work purposes (tradesperson, chef)
- Recreational activities (fishing, camping)
- Religious purposes (e.g., Sikh Kirpan - but NOT in schools)
- Lawful sporting, recreational, or entertainment activities

**Prohibited Knives (always illegal):**
- Butterfly knives (balisongs)
- Flick knives / switchblades
- Disguised knives (belt buckle knives, etc.)
- Double-edged daggers
- Push daggers

---

### 5.5 Kitchen Knives and Household Tools

**Context is Everything:**

| Situation | Likely Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Kitchen knife in kitchen | Legal possession |
| Kitchen knife carried for self-defence | **Illegal** |
| Baseball bat by bed "for intruders" | Problematic if pre-planned |
| Grabbing nearest object during attack | Context of self-defence assessed |

**Key Principle:** The law distinguishes between:
1. **Opportunistic use** of nearby objects during an attack (more defensible)
2. **Pre-positioned weapons** for anticipated confrontation (less defensible, suggests premeditation)

---

### 5.6 Firearms Licensing Overview

**Genuine Reasons Recognized:**
- Sports/target shooting
- Recreational hunting
- Primary production (farming)
- Occupational requirements (security, pest control)
- Collecting (deactivated or antique)

**NOT a Genuine Reason:**
- **Self-defence**
- **Home protection**
- Personal safety
- Fear of crime

**Key Requirements:**
- Valid licence for specific category
- Secure storage (approved safe)
- Background checks
- 28-day waiting period
- Safety training
- Ongoing compliance checks

**Using a Licensed Firearm in Self-Defence:**
Even if you legally own a firearm for hunting, using it in self-defence will be assessed under standard self-defence principles. The legality of possession doesn't automatically justify the use.

---

## 6. Defence of Others

### 6.1 Family Members

**Section 273** explicitly permits you to defend others using the same degree of force they could use themselves.

**Defending Your Family:**
- You can use force to protect your spouse/partner, children, parents
- Your right is derivative - tied to what the family member could lawfully do
- You must act in "good faith"
- All standard self-defence principles apply

**Example:**
If an intruder attacks your spouse and your spouse would be entitled to use lethal force in self-defence (reasonable fear of death/GBH), you too can use lethal force to protect them.

---

### 6.2 Strangers

Section 273 applies to **"any person"** - not just family:

> "...it is lawful for **any other person** acting in good faith in the first person's aid..."

**Considerations When Helping Strangers:**
- Be certain the person you're helping is actually the victim
- Misreading a situation could result in you assaulting the actual victim
- Your force must match what the victim could use
- "Good faith" is essential

---

## 7. Case Law Examples

### 7.1 R v Dayney [2020] QCA 264; [2023] QCA 62; High Court B69/2023

**Facts:**
- Dayney and an accomplice went to a man's house to steal drugs
- A violent altercation ensued
- The homeowner was killed
- Dayney claimed self-defence against "provoked assault"

**Held:**
- Conviction for **murder** upheld
- Queensland Court of Appeal and High Court both dismissed appeals
- High Court Chief Justice Gageler: Dayney had "instigated the confrontation" and was required to retreat from the conflict before using deadly force
- Under s 272 (provoked assault), the duty to retreat applies

**Principle:** If you create the dangerous situation, you must attempt to retreat "as far as practicable" before using lethal force.

**Citation:** [Case B69/2023 - High Court of Australia](https://www.hcourt.gov.au/cases/case_b69-2023)

---

### 7.2 The Bow and Arrow Case (Queensland Court of Appeal)

**Facts:**
- Appellant used a bow and arrow to fatally shoot a would-be intruder
- The shooting occurred on a **concrete slab** linking his house to a nearby shed
- Appellant attempted to rely on section 267 (defence of dwelling)

**Held:**
- Section 267 defence **rejected**
- The concrete slab was **not part of the dwelling house**
- Conviction upheld

**Principle:** Section 267 has geographical limits. It protects the dwelling itself, not all areas of your property.

---

### 7.3 R v Spajic [2011] QCA 232

**Facts:**
- Manslaughter case involving self-defence claim
- Defendant used force against an attacker

**Held:**
- Appeal against conviction **dismissed**
- The jury could reasonably find the appellant did **not believe, on reasonable grounds**, that it was necessary to use the force employed

**Principle:** Even genuine belief is not enough - the belief must have **reasonable grounds**.

---

### 7.4 Zecevic v DPP (1987) 162 CLR 645 (High Court)

**Facts:**
- Defendant killed his neighbour/tenant
- Claimed the victim had a knife and shotgun
- Retrieved his own gun and shot the victim

**Significance:**
- **Leading authority** on self-defence in Australia
- Established the test: "whether the accused believed upon reasonable grounds that it was necessary in self-defence to do what he did"
- Abolished "excessive self-defence" as a separate defence (though it may reduce murder to manslaughter)

---

### 7.5 Cases Where Homeowners Were Found Guilty

Common factors in Queensland cases where occupiers were convicted:
1. **Leaving the home** to confront the intruder
2. Using force **after the threat had passed**
3. Pre-planned violence (lying in wait)
4. Force grossly **disproportionate** to the actual threat
5. Acting on territory **outside the dwelling**

---

## 8. Practical Guidance

### 8.1 During a Home Invasion

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Call 000** if possible - even if you can only leave the line open
2. **Secure family** - get everyone to a safe room if possible
3. **Make noise** - yell "I've called police" (even if you haven't)
4. **Do not leave the dwelling** to confront unless absolutely necessary
5. **If you must act**, remember your belief must be reasonable

**Verbal Deterrence:**
- "I've called the police"
- "I'm armed" (even if improvised - this may deter)
- "Leave now"
- Loud alarm/panic button if available

---

### 8.2 What to Do After a Self-Defence Incident

**Immediate Aftermath:**

1. **Ensure safety** - is the threat neutralised?
2. **Call 000** - report the incident, request ambulance if needed
3. **Render first aid** if safe to do so
4. **Preserve evidence** - do not clean up, move items, or change clothes if possible
5. **Identify witnesses** - note names/contacts

**When Police Arrive:**

**Be cautious.** You have the right to:
- Remain silent (beyond providing your name and address)
- Request legal representation before making a statement
- Not answer questions until you've spoken to a lawyer

**What to Say Initially:**
- "I was attacked/my home was invaded"
- "I feared for my life/my family's safety"
- "I acted to defend myself/my family"
- "I'd like to speak to a lawyer before giving a detailed statement"

**What NOT to Say:**
- Detailed blow-by-blow account before legal advice
- Admissions about intent ("I wanted to hurt him")
- Speculations about what happened
- Anything that might undermine your self-defence claim

---

### 8.3 Documenting the Incident

**As Soon as Practicable:**

1. **Write down everything you remember** - times, sequence, what you saw/heard/felt
2. **Note your mental state** - fear, confusion, what you believed was happening
3. **Photograph injuries** - yours and family members
4. **Preserve clothing** - may have evidence (blood, tears, etc.)
5. **Preserve communications** - texts, calls, CCTV footage
6. **Identify all witnesses** - neighbours, family, bystanders

---

### 8.4 Legal Representation

**Seek a criminal defence lawyer immediately.**

**Resources:**
- Queensland Law Society referral service: (07) 3842 5842
- Legal Aid Queensland: 1300 65 11 88
- Community legal centres (various locations)
- Private criminal defence solicitors

**Why Legal Advice is Critical:**
- Self-defence is a complete defence - if established, you're acquitted
- The burden is on prosecution to **disprove** self-defence
- How you describe events matters enormously
- Early legal advice protects your position

---

## 9. Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "I Can Defend My Property with Any Force"

**FALSE.**

| Property Type | Force Permitted | Limitations |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Dwelling (inside) | Necessary force | Must believe intruder intends indictable offence |
| Land/premises | Reasonable force | **Cannot cause GBH** |
| Moveable property | Reasonable force | **Cannot cause GBH** |

Only section 267 (dwelling defence) permits potentially lethal force, and only in specific circumstances.

---

### Misconception 2: "Castle Doctrine Means I Can Shoot Intruders"

**MISLEADING.**

Queensland's section 267 is **more limited** than American "castle doctrine":
- You must believe the intruder intends to commit an **indictable offence**
- Your belief must be based on **reasonable grounds**
- It only applies to the **dwelling** - not your entire property
- There's no automatic immunity from prosecution

---

### Misconception 3: "Warning Shots Are a Good Idea"

**FALSE - WARNING SHOTS ARE LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC.**

- Firing a warning shot demonstrates you had time to consider your actions
- It may suggest the threat wasn't imminent enough to require shooting at the person
- Discharging a firearm carries its own offences if not justified
- Even police are trained **not** to fire warning shots

---

### Misconception 4: "I Can Chase and Apprehend Someone Who Robbed Me"

**DANGEROUS MISCONCEPTION.**

**Citizen's Arrest Powers (s 546 Criminal Code):**

You may arrest (without warrant) a person:
- Found **committing** an offence (not after the fact, generally)
- You believe on reasonable grounds has committed an arrestable offence

**But:**
- You must hand them to police **without delay**
- You cannot use excessive force
- If you get it wrong, you face liability for:
  - False imprisonment
  - Assault
  - Battery
  - Civil damages

**Hot pursuit** of a fleeing offender is **not** well-protected in Queensland law.

---

### Misconception 5: "I Can Carry a Knife for Self-Defence"

**FALSE.**

Section 51 Weapons Act 1990 explicitly states that **self-defence is NOT a reasonable excuse** for carrying a knife in public.

Penalty: Up to 1 year imprisonment or $4,680 fine.

---

### Misconception 6: "If I'm Attacked, I Can Use Equal Force"

**NUANCED.**

You can use force that is **reasonably necessary** to defend yourself. This doesn't mean "equal" - it means appropriate to the threat:
- You may use **more** force if facing a stronger attacker
- You may use **less** force if you significantly overpower the attacker
- The test is what you **reasonably believed** was necessary

---

### Misconception 7: "Pre-Positioning Weapons for Home Defence is Smart"

**LEGALLY RISKY.**

Having weapons pre-positioned for anticipated confrontation may suggest:
- Premeditation
- Intention to cause harm
- Disproportionate response

This can undermine a self-defence claim. The law looks more favourably on **reactive** use of available objects than **proactive** weapon positioning.

---

## 10. Quick Reference Summary

### Your Rights at a Glance

| Scenario | Your Rights | Key Limitation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Unprovoked attack** | Use reasonably necessary force | Lethal force only if fear death/GBH |
| **Home invasion (inside dwelling)** | Use necessary force (including lethal) | Must believe intruder intends indictable offence |
| **Trespasser on land** | Use reasonable force | Cannot cause GBH |
| **Someone taking your property** | Use reasonable force | Cannot cause GBH |
