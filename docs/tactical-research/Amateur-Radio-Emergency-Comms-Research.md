## 1. Amateur Radio Licensing in Australia

### ACMA Licensing Structure

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) regulates amateur radio in Australia. As of February 2024, a new class licence system replaced individual amateur licences.

**Key Change (February 2024):** You no longer need to apply for an individual ACMA licence. If you hold a recognised qualification (Foundation, Standard, or Advanced), you can operate under the class licence without fees.

### The Three Licence Levels

| Level | Power Limit | Bands | Equipment | Key Features |
|-------|-------------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Foundation** | 10W PEP | 80m, 40m, 15m, 10m, 2m, 70cm | Commercial only | Voice (SSB/AM/FM) and CW |
| **Standard** | 100W PEP | All amateur bands | Can build/modify | All modes including digital |
| **Advanced** | 400W PEP | All amateur bands | Full privileges | All modes, beacons, repeaters |

### Foundation Licence Details

The Foundation licence is the entry-level qualification designed to be accessible for newcomers:

- **Exam:** 25 multiple-choice questions plus practical assessment
- **Training:** Typically a one-day course (Saturday or Sunday, 08:30-16:30)
- **Cost:** Free class licence (no annual fees)
- **Frequency Access:**
  - HF: 3.5-3.7 MHz (80m), 7.0-7.1 MHz (40m), 21.0-21.45 MHz (15m), 28.0-29.7 MHz (10m)
  - VHF: 144-148 MHz (2m)
  - UHF: 430-450 MHz (70cm)
- **Equipment:** Must use commercially manufactured transceivers (homebrew antennas are fine)

### Exam Process

1. Study using resources (see Section 6)
2. Book assessment through WIA-authorised assessor or local club
3. Sit written exam (25 questions) and practical assessment
4. Results submitted to ACMA
5. ACMA issues official callsign and call sign certificate

**Note:** Morse code is no longer required for any Australian amateur radio licence (removed in 2003).

## 7. Practical Communication Planning

### Family Communication Plan

**Establish the Following:**

1. **Primary Channel/Frequency:**
   - Local VHF/UHF simplex frequency (e.g., 146.500 MHz calling)
   - Or specific repeater with backup simplex

2. **Check-in Schedule (3-3-3 Rule):**
   - Listen every 3 hours
   - For at least 3 minutes
   - On channel 3 (or your designated frequency)
   - Good schedule: 0600, 0900, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2100

3. **Backup Channels:**
   - Secondary frequency if primary is busy/blocked
   - Different band (if VHF fails, try UHF or vice versa)
   - Meshtastic as text backup

4. **Meeting Points:**
   - Rally point if separated
   - Know direction to travel if comms fail completely

5. **Code Words (Optional):**
   - "All clear" = safe
   - "Charlie" = come to rally point
   - Note: Amateur radio requires transmissions to be unencrypted, but simple codes are acceptable

### Expected Ranges

**Handheld (5W) - Simplex (Direct):**
| Environment | Range |
|-------------|-------|
| Urban area | 1-3 km |
| Suburban | 3-8 km |
| Open terrain | 8-15 km |
| Elevated position | 15-30+ km |
| Mountainous terrain | Line of sight only |

**Handheld to Repeater:**
| Scenario | Range |
|----------|-------|
| Urban to elevated repeater | 10-30 km |
| Suburban to elevated repeater | 30-70 km |
| Good elevation both ends | 100+ km |

**Mobile (50W) - Through Repeater:**
| Scenario | Range |
|----------|-------|
| Typical | 50-100 km |
| Well-sited repeater | 150+ km |

**HF Radio (100W) - Direct:**
| Band | Typical Range |
|------|---------------|
| 80m (night) | 500-2000 km |
| 40m | 1000-4000 km |
| 20m | Worldwide |

**Key Principle:** "Spend money on the antenna" - A quality antenna on a handheld can extend range significantly. Height is critical for VHF/UHF.

### Battery and Power Considerations

**Battery Types:**

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Lead-acid (SLA) | Cheap, available | Heavy, limited cycles |
| LiFePO4 | Light, 4000+ cycles, -40C operation | Higher upfront cost |
| Lithium-ion | Common, light | Less rugged, fewer cycles |

**Sizing Your Battery:**

| Radio Power | Typical Draw | 12V 20Ah Runtime |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Handheld (5W) | 2A TX, 0.3A RX | 10+ hours mixed |
| Mobile (50W) | 10A TX, 1A RX | 2-4 hours mixed |
| HF (100W) | 20A TX, 2A RX | 1-2 hours mixed |

**Recommendations:**
- **Minimum:** 12V 20Ah LiFePO4 ($200-300 AUD)
- **Recommended:** 12V 50-100Ah LiFePO4 ($500-800 AUD)
- **Charging:** Solar panel (100W) + MPPT controller for off-grid

**Power Station Alternative:**
- Jackery/Bluetti style portable power stations work well
- 500Wh+ recommended for extended operations

### Emergency Kit Checklist
