## 1. Australian Drone Regulations (CASA)

### 1.1 Recreational Drone Rules

Recreational drone operators in Australia:
- **Do NOT need** a licence, registration, or accreditation (as of March 2025, the proposed registration scheme was paused)
- **No age limit** applies to flying drones for fun

#### Key Safety Rules for Recreational Pilots

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Maximum altitude** | 120 metres (400 feet) above ground level |
| **Distance from people** | At least 30 metres from people (forms a dome around them) |
| **Flying over people** | Never permitted at any altitude |
| **Operating hours** | Daylight only |
| **Line of sight** | Must maintain visual line-of-sight at all times |
| **Number of drones** | Only one drone at a time |
| **Populous areas** | Cannot fly in populous areas (beaches, parks, events, sports ovals during games) |
| **Airport proximity** | Drones >250g must stay 5.5km from controlled airports |
| **Airport proximity (<250g)** | Drones 250g or lighter may fly within 5.5km up to 45m, but not in approach/departure paths |

#### The 30-Metre Rule Explained

The 30-metre rule creates a **dome** (not a cylinder) around people:
- Measured from a point on the ground to the underside of the aircraft in all directions
- Combined with the "populous" rule, this effectively prohibits flying over people and their immediate vicinity
- Operators should never fly in a way that creates a hazard to another person, property, or aircraft

### 1.2 Commercial Drone Rules

Commercial drone operators face stricter requirements:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Registration** | Mandatory for ALL drones used for business (regardless of weight) - $40/year |
| **Remote Pilot Licence (RePL)** | Required for most commercial operations |
| **Remote Operator's Certificate (ReOC)** | Required for commercial operations |
| **Distance from people** | Can operate 15-30m from people with ReOC, closer requires CASA approval |

Commercial use includes: selling aerial photos/videos, inspections, monitoring/security, and R&D.

### 1.3 What Constitutes Illegal Drone Operation

A drone operator is breaking CASA rules if they:

1. Fly higher than 120 metres above ground level
2. Fly within 30 metres of people (or over them at any height)
3. Fly at night
4. Fly beyond visual line-of-sight
5. Fly in a populous area
6. Fly within 5.5km of a controlled airport (for drones >250g)
7. Fly in a way that creates a hazard to people, property, or aircraft
8. Fly while operating multiple drones simultaneously
9. Fly for commercial purposes without proper licensing and registration

**Important:** CASA regulates aviation safety, not privacy. Privacy violations are handled under different legislation.

### 1.4 How to Report Illegal Drone Activity

#### Reporting to CASA

- **Online form:** CASA provides a specific form for reporting drone safety violations at [casa.gov.au](https://www.casa.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/drone-complaints)
- **Time limit:** File reports within 72 hours for best results
- **Response time:** CASA typically responds within 10 business days
- **Limitation:** CASA cannot provide feedback on your report or outcomes

#### Evidence Requirements for CASA

For a successful report, gather:
- Time, date, and location
- Description of drone behaviour
- Photos or videos of the breach
- If possible, photos/video of the person controlling the drone
- Identifying features of the drone
- Direction the drone came from/departed to
- Witness statements if available

#### When to Contact Police Instead

Contact Queensland Police (131 444) if:
- You feel unsafe
- You believe illegal activity is taking place
- The behaviour may breach harassment or trespass laws
- You believe you are being stalked
- Someone is using a drone to plan a crime

### 1.5 Penalties for Violations

| Penalty Type | Amount |
|--------------|--------|
| **On-the-spot fine** | Up to $1,650 per offence |
| **Court-imposed fine** | Up to $16,500 |
| **Endangering aircraft** | Criminal charges, up to 2 years imprisonment |
| **Serious offences** | Referral to Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions |

## 2. Property Owner Rights in Queensland

### 2.1 Airspace Ownership - The Legal Framework

#### The *Cuius Est Solum* Doctrine

Historically, the Latin maxim "*Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos*" governed airspace ownership - meaning if you own the land, you own from heaven to hell.

**Modern limitation:** Australian courts have limited this to practical heights necessary for "ordinary use and enjoyment" of the land (*Baron Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd* [1978]).

#### The Test for Airspace Trespass

Under *LJP Investments Pty Ltd v Howard Chia Investments Pty Ltd* (1989), an incursion into airspace is trespass if it is:
> "of a nature and at a height which may interfere with any ordinary uses of the land which the occupier may see fit to undertake"

**Key point:** Actual interference isn't necessary - the *possibility* of interference is enough. No damage need be proven.

#### Queensland Case Law

**Graham v KD Morris & Sons Pty Ltd [1974] Qd R 1:**
- A crane jib 19 metres (62 feet) above ground was held to be trespass
- The court found it "interfered with the owner's proper use and enjoyment of her land"
- It was "an unsightly feature and a cause of nervousness and apprehension for the owner"

This case suggests that drones flying low over property, particularly if causing distress, could constitute trespass.

### 2.2 Current Legal Status of Drone Overflight

**The uncomfortable truth:** There's no clear case law in Australia yet that definitively defines drone trespass over private property.

**General position:**
- CASA does not regulate flying over private property from a privacy perspective
- Drones CAN legally fly over private property under aviation law
- However, state laws regarding trespass, privacy, and harassment may apply

**When trespass is more likely to be found:**
- Repeated, intentional flights over property without permission
- Flying at low altitudes
- Attempting to film through windows
- Hovering directly above a house

### 2.3 Queensland Privacy Laws

#### Criminal Code Section 227A - Observations or Recordings in Breach of Privacy

This is a **criminal offence** in Queensland with a maximum penalty of **3 years imprisonment**.

**Prohibited conduct:**
- Visually recording another person without consent
- In circumstances where a reasonable adult would expect privacy
- When the person is in a private place OR engaged in a private act
- Recording made for the purpose of capturing a private act

**Application to different locations:**

| Location | Privacy Expectation | Likely Breach? |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Inside house | Highest degree of privacy | Yes - filming would breach 227A |
| Backyard | High degree of privacy | Likely breach in most circumstances |
| Front yard | Moderate | Depends on visibility from public areas |

**Private acts include:** showering, using toilet, sexual intercourse, getting dressed, undressing

**Also illegal:** Possession, sale, or supply of recordings made in breach of this section.

#### Invasion of Privacy Act 1971 (Qld)

This Act regulates **listening devices** (audio recording):
- Prohibits using listening devices to record, monitor, or listen to private conversations
- **Applies to drones with audio recording functions**
- Does NOT regulate optical (video/photo) surveillance
- Exception: Recording is not prohibited if you are a party to the conversation

**Limitation:** This Act only covers audio, not video surveillance.

### 2.4 Federal Privacy Act Limitations

**Critical gap:** The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) does NOT apply to:
- Individuals acting in a private capacity
- Organisations with annual turnover under $3 million

This means most recreational drone operators are NOT covered by federal privacy legislation.

**When it DOES apply:**
- Government agencies
- Organisations with turnover over $3 million
- Health service providers
- Some other specified organisations

If covered, organisations must:
- Tell you that your image may be captured before recording
- Ensure recorded personal information is secure
- Destroy or de-identify data when no longer needed

### 2.5 Legal Remedies Available

#### 1. Direct Communication
- Speak to the operator directly if you can identify them
- Send a formal letter of demand requesting they stop

#### 2. Report to Authorities
- **CASA:** For safety rule violations
- **Police:** For stalking, harassment, or suspected criminal activity
- **OAIC/OIC Queensland:** For privacy complaints (if covered entity)

#### 3. Civil Action
- **Trespass to land:** If drone repeatedly flies low over property
- **Nuisance:** For ongoing disturbance of enjoyment of property
- **Breach of privacy:** Under tort law (developing area)

#### 4. Protection Orders
- **Peace and Good Behaviour Order (PGBO):** For ongoing harassment
- **Domestic Violence Order (DVO):** If relevant domestic relationship exists

### 2.6 Stalking and Harassment Laws

Under the **Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld)**, stalking includes:
- Intimidation
- Harassment
- Unlawful surveillance
- Repeated unwanted contact

**Penalties:**
- Standard: 5 years imprisonment
- With aggravating factors (violence): 7 years
- Against law enforcement officer: 10 years

Drone surveillance may constitute stalking if it is repeated, targeted, and intended to cause apprehension.

## 3. Drone Capabilities - General Awareness

Understanding what consumer drones can actually do helps homeowners assess realistic privacy risks.

### 3.1 Camera Capabilities

#### Current Consumer Drones (2025-2026)

| Drone Model | Sensor | Photo Resolution | Video | Zoom Capability |
|-------------|--------|------------------|-------|-----------------|
| DJI Mavic 4 Pro | 4/3" Hasselblad | 100MP | 4K/60fps | Up to 28x hybrid |
| DJI Mavic 3 Pro | 4/3" Hasselblad | 20MP | 5.1K | 1-28x (across 3 cameras) |
| DJI Air 3S | 1" CMOS | 50MP | 4K/60fps | Digital zoom |
| DJI Mini 5 Pro | 1" CMOS | 50MP | 4K/60fps | Digital zoom |
| DJI Mavic 2 Zoom | 1/2.3" CMOS | 12-48MP | 4K/30fps | 2x optical, 4x lossless |

#### What Can Drones See at Various Distances?

**At 30 metres (CASA minimum distance):**
- Can clearly see people and identify faces with zoom
- Can read large text on signs
- Can see details of outdoor furniture and objects
- With zoom: Can potentially see through windows if unobscured

**At 120 metres (maximum legal height):**
- Property layout clearly visible
- People visible but faces harder to identify
- Individual items on property visible
- Pool, garden, vehicles easily documented

**Key concern:** Modern drones with 28x zoom capability can capture detailed images from significant distances while still appearing to be far away.

### 3.2 Audio Recording Capabilities

**Good news for privacy:** Consumer drones have very limited audio capabilities.

**Limitations:**
- Most consumer drones (DJI Mavic, Mini, Phantom series) do not have built-in microphones
- Propeller noise and wind create overwhelming interference
- Audio quality from internal camera mics is generally unusable
- The rotating propellers generate turbulence that drowns out ground-level sounds

**Professional solutions exist** (external microphones, DJI Mic system) but these are uncommon in consumer use and still face wind noise challenges.

**Legal note:** If a drone IS recording audio in Queensland, the Invasion of Privacy Act 1971 applies.

### 3.3 Flight Time and Range

| Drone Model | Flight Time (Advertised) | Real-World Flight | Transmission Range |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| DJI Mavic 4 Pro | 51 minutes | 40-45 minutes | 20km |
| DJI Air 3S | 45 minutes | 35-40 minutes | 15km |
| DJI Mavic 3 Pro | 43 minutes | 35-38 minutes | 15km |
| DJI Mini 5 Pro (Plus battery) | 52 minutes | 40-45 minutes | 15km |
| DJI Mini 5 Pro (Standard) | 36 minutes | 28-32 minutes | 15km |
| Original Mavic Mini | 30 minutes | 22-26 minutes | 4km |

**Real-world factors reducing flight time:**
- Wind conditions
- Temperature (cold reduces battery performance)
- Altitude (thinner air requires more power)
- Aggressive flying manoeuvres

**Practical implication:** A drone hovering over your property will typically need to return to its operator within 15-25 minutes for battery change.

### 3.4 Noise Characteristics

Consumer drones produce distinctive sounds that can help identify them:

- **High-pitched buzzing:** From propellers, typically 65-80 dB at close range
- **Audible at 30-100 metres:** Depending on ambient noise
- **Quieter at altitude:** Less audible above 50 metres
- **Sub-250g drones:** Generally quieter than larger models

## 4. Legal Privacy Protection Methods

### 4.1 Physical Privacy Measures

#### Vertical Privacy (Aerial Observation)

| Solution | Effectiveness | Considerations |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Pergolas with solid roofs** | High - blocks aerial view | Check council permits for structures |
| **Shade sails** | Moderate-High | Can be positioned to block aerial angles |
| **Covered outdoor areas** | High | Permanent solution, adds property value |
| **Retractable awnings** | Moderate | Flexible, can be extended when needed |
| **Dense tree canopy** | High when mature | Takes years to establish, natural look |

#### Horizontal Privacy (Ground-Level Observation)

| Solution | Effectiveness | Considerations |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Privacy screens** | Moderate | Easy to install, various materials |
| **Hedges** | High when mature | Natural, requires maintenance |
| **Lattice with climbers** | Moderate-High | Attractive, allows airflow |
| **Solid fencing** | High | Check height limits (typically 1.8m without permit) |
| **Frosted window film** | High for windows | Affects natural light |

### 4.2 Landscaping for Privacy

**Recommended Plants for Queensland:**

| Plant Type | Growth Rate | Height | Privacy Rating |
|------------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Bamboo (clumping varieties) | Fast | 3-8m | Excellent |
| Lilly Pilly | Moderate | 3-6m | Excellent |
| Murraya | Moderate | 2-3m | Good |
| Photinia | Moderate | 3-4m | Good |
| Native hibiscus | Fast | 2-3m | Moderate |

**Layered approach:**
1. Tall trees for canopy cover (aerial privacy)
2. Medium hedges for boundary screening
3. Lower shrubs for additional density

### 4.3 Legal Considerations for Property Modifications

Before installing privacy measures:

1. **Check local council regulations:**
   - Maximum fence heights (typically 1.8m in front, 2m elsewhere)
   - Setback requirements from boundaries
   - Pool fencing compliance
   - Heritage overlays

2. **HOA/Body Corporate rules:**
   - Colour and material restrictions
   - Height limitations
   - Approval processes

3. **Neighbour notification:**
   - Some structures may require neighbour consent
   - Tree planting near boundaries has specific rules

4. **Building permits:**
   - Pergolas over certain sizes require approval
   - Shade structures may need engineering certification

### 4.4 What You CANNOT Legally Do

**Illegal responses to drones:**

| Action | Why It's Illegal | Potential Penalty |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Shooting down a drone | Damaging aircraft, weapons offence | Fines up to $10,500, criminal charges |
| Using signal jammers | Radiocommunications Act 1992 violation | Significant fines, criminal charges |
| Physically interfering with drone | Property damage, assault | Criminal charges |
| Throwing objects at drone | Damaging aircraft | Fines, criminal charges |
| Laser pointers at drone | Aviation safety offence | Up to $11,100 fine |

**Visual identification:**
- Multi-rotor design (usually 4 propellers)
- Size ranges from palm-sized to large dinner plate
- LEDs often visible, especially at dusk
- Camera gimbal visible underneath (silver/black dome)

**Audio identification:**
- High-pitched buzzing sound
- Sound changes pitch when manoeuvring
- Generally louder when closer or descending

**Common consumer drones appearance:**
- DJI drones: Grey/silver body, folding arms
- Sub-250g drones: Very small, lightweight appearance
- Larger drones: More industrial appearance, louder

### 5.2 Documenting Drone Activity

## 6. Commercial Drone Detection Systems

### 6.1 Overview of Detection Technologies

Large facilities (airports, stadiums, prisons) use sophisticated systems to detect drones:

| Technology | How It Works | Detection Range |
|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **RF Detection** | Scans radio frequencies (70MHz-6GHz) for drone-controller communication | 1-5km+ |
| **Radar** | Detects physical presence of flying objects | 1-10km+ |
| **Acoustic sensors** | Identifies drone propeller sounds | 100-500m |
| **Optical/Thermal cameras** | Visual tracking and identification | 500m-2km |
| **Multi-sensor fusion** | Combines all above technologies | Varies |

### 6.2 RF Detection Explained

**How it works:**
- Most commercial drones communicate with controllers via RF signals
- RF sensors scan frequency ranges for these transmissions
- Multiple sensors enable triangulation of drone position
- Can identify drone manufacturer and sometimes specific model
- Can detect both drone AND pilot location

**Limitations:**
- Cannot detect fully autonomous drones (no RF signal)
- Urban environments create RF reflections
- Crowded RF spectrum reduces accuracy
- Requires multiple sensors for accurate positioning

### 6.3 Why This Matters for Homeowners

**Reality check:** Commercial detection systems are:
- Expensive ($10,000 - $500,000+)
- Designed for large facilities, not residential use
- May require licensing or approval to operate
- Overkill for residential concerns

**Counter-measures (jamming) are illegal:** Only federal agencies can legally use drone countermeasures in Australia.

**Practical alternative:** Document incidents, report to authorities, implement physical privacy measures.
