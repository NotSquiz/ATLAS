## 1. EMP Threat Analysis

### 1.1 Nuclear EMP (HEMP) - The Three Pulse Components

A high-altitude nuclear detonation (typically 30-400km altitude) produces three distinct electromagnetic pulse components that arrive in rapid sequence:

#### E1 Component (Early-Time/Fast Pulse)

| Characteristic | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Rise Time** | Nanoseconds (first 10 nanoseconds critical) |
| **Duration** | Few hundred nanoseconds |
| **Peak Field Strength** | 25-50 kV/m (standard weapons), up to 200 kV/m (Super-EMP weapons) |
| **Frequency Content** | Broadband 0-1000 MHz |
| **Induced Currents** | Up to thousands of amperes |

**Mechanism**: Gamma rays from nuclear detonation rip electrons from atoms in the upper atmosphere. The Earth's magnetic field deflects these electrons, creating an intense electromagnetic shockwave.

**What E1 Damages**:
- Integrated circuits and microprocessors
- Computer equipment and data processing systems
- Communications electronics
- Digital engine control systems
- Electronic flight controls
- Industrial control systems
- Any equipment connected to cables acting as antennas

**Critical Point**: E1 arrives so fast that ordinary surge protectors cannot react. Protection requires shielding or nanosecond-response surge devices.

#### E2 Component (Intermediate-Time Pulse)

| Characteristic | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Duration** | 1 microsecond to 1 second |
| **Characteristics** | Similar to lightning-induced pulses |
| **Threat Level** | Generally easiest to protect against |

**Mechanism**: Generated by scattered gamma rays and gamma emissions from neutron collisions.

**Primary Threat**: E2 arrives after E1 may have already compromised lightning protection systems. Devices that would normally survive E2 (with intact lightning protection) may be vulnerable if E1 has damaged their protective circuits.

#### E3 Component (Late-Time/Slow Pulse)

| Characteristic | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| **Duration** | Tens to hundreds of seconds |
| **Frequency** | Sub-Hertz pulses |
| **Mechanism** | Nuclear detonation distorts Earth's magnetic field |
| **Similarity** | Geomagnetic storms from severe solar flares |

**What E3 Damages**:
- Long electrical conductors (power transmission lines)
- Bulk transformers with grounded Y-type windings
- Undersea cables
- Pipeline systems

**Critical Infrastructure Impact**: E3 induces Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) in power grid infrastructure, potentially causing widespread transformer failures and cascading blackouts.

#### Super-EMP Weapons

Russian military documentation describes "Super-EMP" weapons that can generate 200 kV/m - many times the 30 kV/m attributed to standard high-yield nuclear weapons. These weapons:
- Have small explosive yields (possibly 1 kiloton)
- Specially designed to produce primarily gamma rays
- Generate overwhelming E1 component
- Produce little or no E2/E3 (but don't need to)

### 1.2 Solar Events (Coronal Mass Ejections)

#### The Carrington Event (1859) - Historical Benchmark

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Classification** | Most intense geomagnetic storm in recorded history |
| **CME Velocity** | ~2,300 km/s |
| **Energy Release** | ~10^32 ergs |
| **Earth Transit Time** | 17.6 hours (extremely fast) |
| **Date** | September 1-2, 1859 |

**Documented Effects**:
- Telegraph systems across Europe and North America failed
- Telegraph operators received electric shocks
- Telegraph pylons threw sparks
- Telegraph stations caught fire
- Some telegraph systems continued operating using only aurora-induced current (no batteries)
- Auroras visible as far south as the Caribbean
- Railroad service interrupted for days (telegraph-dependent signaling)

#### Modern CME Events

| Event | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **1989 Quebec** | Hydro-Quebec grid collapse, 9-hour blackout, millions affected. Only 1/5 strength of Carrington Event |
| **1972 Solar Flare** | Auroras to Texas, detonated US Navy sea mines in Vietnam via magnetic sensor triggering |
| **July 2012** | Carrington-class superstorm narrowly missed Earth |
| **March 2022** | 40 SpaceX Starlink satellites failed |

#### CME vs HEMP Comparison

| Factor | CME/Solar | Nuclear HEMP |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Primary Effect** | E3-like (slow, long conductors) | All three (E1, E2, E3) |
| **Small Electronics** | Generally safe (not connected to long lines) | Vulnerable to E1 |
| **Power Grid** | Primary target | Primary target |
| **Warning Time** | 17-72 hours typical | None |
| **Intensity** | Varies widely | Predictable based on weapon |

**Frequency Estimates**:
- Ice core data suggests Carrington-scale events ~1 per 150 years
- Conservative estimates: ~1 per 500 years
- Limited historical records make precise estimation difficult

#### Economic Impact Projections

Lloyd's of London/AER joint research (2013): A Carrington-level event today would cost the US alone **$600 billion to $2.6 trillion**.

### 1.3 Non-Nuclear EMP (NNEMP) Devices

#### Types of NNEMP Weapons

| Device Type | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Large Capacitor Bank Systems** | Low-inductance capacitors discharged into single-loop antenna |
| **Microwave Generators** | High-power microwave (HPM) weapons |
| **Explosively Pumped Flux Compression Generators (EPFCG)** | Chemical explosives compress magnetic flux |
| **CHAMP Cruise Missiles** | Counter-Electronics High Power Microwave Advanced Missile Project |
| **THOR System** | Air Force microwave anti-drone system |
| **HiJENKS** | High-Powered Joint Electromagnetic Non-Kinetic Strike Weapon |

#### Documented Capabilities

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Effective Range** | Few hundred yards to few miles (device-dependent) |
| **Field Strength** | Up to 100,000 V/m (short distances) |
| **HPM Range** | Up to 10 kilometers |
| **Output Power** | Hundreds of MW to tens of GW |
| **Pulse Characteristics** | Short pulse width, low repetition rate |

**1993 Eglin AFB Test**: NNEMP device fried electronic engine parts and alternators of cars parked hundreds of yards away.

#### Threat Assessment

**State Actor Capabilities**:
- China and Russia have documented HEMP and NNEMP capabilities in military doctrine
- Russia considered world leader in NNEMP/Radio-Frequency Weapons
- Marriage of NNEMP to drones/cruise missiles presents major grid threat
- Targeted attacks on 9 of 2,000 US EHV transformer substations could cascade to nationwide blackout (US FERC restricted study)

**Accessibility Concerns**:
- NNEMP weapons can be manufactured using commercial equipment
- Design information available on internet
- 2000 HASC experiment proved small team with competent engineer could build NNEMP weapon using unclassified internet resources
- Suitcase EMP generators purchasable online (no license required)

### 1.4 Electronics Vulnerability Summary

#### Devices Most Vulnerable to E1

| Category | Examples | Vulnerability |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Microprocessor-based** | Computers, smartphones, modern vehicles | HIGH |
| **Connected to long lines** | Grid-connected equipment, wired communications | HIGH |
| **Sensitive semiconductors** | Integrated circuits, MOSFETs | HIGH |
| **Digital control systems** | Industrial SCADA, engine ECUs | HIGH |

#### Devices Likely to Survive (Unprotected)

| Category | Examples | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Simple mechanical** | Hand tools, manual equipment | No electronics |
| **Disconnected/small** | Hand-held radios (off), portable generators (disconnected) | Not acting as antenna |
| **Battery-powered (disconnected)** | Batteries, flashlights (if LED driver survives) | Electrochemical unaffected |
| **Pre-electronic vehicles** | Pre-1960s points ignition, mechanical fuel | No vulnerable electronics |

#### Geographic Vulnerability Factors

- **Latitude**: Higher latitudes more vulnerable to E3/GIC effects (closer to magnetic poles)
- **Ground Conductivity**: Areas with poor ground conductivity experience higher GIC effects
- **Grid Topology**: Longer transmission lines = greater antenna effect
- **Altitude**: E1 coverage area increases with detonation altitude

## 2. Faraday Protection Technical Details

### 2.1 Shielding Effectiveness Requirements

#### Military and IEEE Standards

| Standard | Application | Minimum Requirements |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **MIL-STD-188-125-1** | Fixed ground-based C4I facilities | E1 protection, verified testing |
| **MIL-STD-188-125-2** | Transportable C4I systems | E1 protection, verified testing |
| **IEEE 299-2006** | General shielded enclosures | Test methodology 9 kHz - 18 GHz |
| **IEEE 299.1-2013** | Small enclosures (0.1m - 2m) | Test methodology |
| **MIL-STD-285** | Military enclosures | 100 dB @ 20-10,000 Hz |

#### Required Attenuation Levels

| Frequency Range | Minimum Attenuation | Notes |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Up to 10 MHz** | 100 dB | Per IEEE 299 |
| **10 MHz - 1 GHz** | 80 dB | Per IEEE 299 |
| **Above 1 GHz** | 60 dB | Per IEEE 299 |
| **Military minimum** | 80 dB | Per US military requirements |
| **Effective DIY target** | 40-50 dB minimum | Practical protection |

**Understanding Decibels**:
- 10-30 dB: Least effective shielding
- 40-50 dB: Minimum effective EMP protection
- 60-90 dB: Highly effective
- 90-120 dB: Exceptional (military-grade)
- Note: dB is logarithmic - every 10 dB = 10x reduction

### 2.2 Material Comparison

#### Shielding Effectiveness by Material

| Material | Relative Effectiveness | Best For | Key Properties |
|----------|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Copper** | 100% (baseline) | High-frequency EMI | Highest conductivity, corrosion resistant, most expensive |
| **Aluminum** | ~60% of copper | High-frequency, weight-sensitive | Lightweight, cost-effective, oxidizes |
| **Galvanized Steel** | Lowest for RF | Low-frequency magnetic fields | Magnetic shielding, structural strength, cheapest |
| **Mu-metal** | Specialized | Low-frequency magnetic | Very high permeability |

#### Material-Specific Performance

**Aluminum Foil**:
- 85+ dB shielding at 30-100 MHz
- Inadequate for low-frequency magnetic fields
- Requires thick steel or ferrite for low frequencies

**Copper Mesh/Sheet**:
- Best overall conductivity
- Excellent for high-frequency shielding
- Most expensive option

**Galvanized Steel (Trash Cans)**:
- Good structural option for DIY
- Requires seam treatment
- Provides magnetic shielding copper/aluminum lack

#### Shielding Mechanisms

1. **Reflection Loss**: Impedance mismatch between air and metal (primary mechanism)
2. **Penetration/Absorption Loss**: Heat dissipation from ohmic loss as EM wave penetrates metal
3. **Multi-reflection Loss**: Secondary reflections inside inner metal layer

**Practical Note**: Any calculated attenuation above 100 dB means material is essentially impenetrable. Most test equipment maxes at 80-120 dB dynamic range.

### 2.3 Seam Treatment and Construction

#### Critical Vulnerability Points (Galvanized Trash Can)

1. **Handle attachment holes** (visible inside can)
2. **Factory seams** (may have small openings)
3. **Lid-to-can gap** (most critical)

#### Sealing Methods

| Method | Effectiveness Improvement | Cost |
|--------|--------------------------|------|
| **Aluminum HVAC tape on seams** | Basic can (18 dB) → 40 dB | Low (~$5-10 AUD) |
| **Conductive gasket on lid** | 40 dB → 52+ dB | Medium (~$20-40 AUD) |
| **Copper tape + conductive adhesive** | Similar to gasket | Medium |

**Conductive Gaskets**: Conductive fabric over flexible foam with adhesive backing. Apply to inside of lid where top bends to sides.

### 2.4 Grounding Considerations

**IMPORTANT - Conflicting Guidance**:

| Perspective | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Do NOT ground** | Leave isolated | Ground wire can act as antenna during E2/E3, potentially introducing more EM energy |
| **DO ground** | Connect to earth rod | Shunts EMP/CME energy to earth |

**Best Practice**: For small DIY Faraday cages protecting stored equipment, **do not ground**. Grounding is more relevant for facility-scale protection with proper engineering.

### 2.5 Nested Faraday Protection

#### Why Nested Protection Matters

- Single galvanized trash can: ~40-50 dB (with proper sealing)
- Double layer (nested): ~80 dB (approaching military spec)
- Each layer provides multiplicative attenuation

#### Nested Construction Method

1. Insulate device (plastic bag/cardboard)
2. Wrap in heavy-duty aluminum foil
3. Place in plastic bag
4. Place in sealed metal container (ammo can)
5. Place ammo can in sealed trash can

**Commercial Products**: Mission Darkness TitanRF and GoDark bags offer 2-layer construction with 105+ dB attenuation, certified to MIL-STD-188-125.

### 2.6 Testing Methods

#### Why Common DIY Tests Fail

| Test Method | Problem |
|-------------|---------|
| **Cell phone signal** | Wrong frequency (cellular ≠ EMP spectrum), unknown signal strength/sensitivity |
| **Two-way radio** | Correct frequency (462/467 MHz) but too powerful and too sensitive |
| **AM/FM radio** | Only tests limited frequencies, not full spectrum |
| **Light leak test** | Visual gaps ≠ RF gaps |

#### Proper Testing Method

**Equipment Required**:
- Signal generator with variable output
- Spectrum analyzer (expensive)
- Stub antenna (to reduce transmit power)
- Variable attenuator
- Shielded receive enclosure

**Process**:
1. Place spectrum analyzer inside enclosure
2. Generate known signal outside
3. Measure signal inside
4. Calculate attenuation in dB

**DIY Approximation**:
1. Use two-way radio with stub antenna (reduced power)
2. Place receiving radio in shielded enclosure inside test cage
3. Use variable attenuator to quantify attenuation
4. Compare readings inside vs outside

**Target**: Minimum 40-50 dB attenuation across frequencies 10 MHz - 1 GHz.

## 3. Vehicle Considerations

### 3.1 Modern Vehicle Vulnerability Assessment

#### Electronics in Modern Vehicles

| Component | Vulnerability | Consequence of Failure |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| **ECU (Engine Control Unit)** | HIGH | Engine won't start/run |
| **Electronic Fuel Injection** | HIGH | No fuel delivery |
| **Ignition Control Module** | HIGH | No spark |
| **Alternator (solid-state regulator)** | MEDIUM | Battery drain, eventual stop |
| **ABS Controller** | MEDIUM | Loss of ABS (brakes still work) |
| **Airbag Controller** | MEDIUM | Airbags may not deploy |
| **Instrument Cluster** | MEDIUM | No gauges (car may still run) |
| **Infotainment** | MEDIUM | Non-critical failure |

**Typical Modern Vehicle**: 100+ microprocessors, 50+ ECUs, 5 miles of wiring, 100 million lines of code.

### 3.2 EMP Commission Vehicle Test Results (2004)

**Study Parameters**:
- 50 vehicles tested
- Model years: 1987-2002
- EMP exposure: Up to 50 kV/m

**Results**:

| Outcome | Count | Percentage |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **Completely disabled (wouldn't restart)** | 1 | 2% |
| **Shut down while driving** | 3 | 6% |
| **Restarted after shutdown** | 2 | 4% |
| **Nuisance effects only** | Multiple | Variable |

**Nuisance Effects Observed**:
- Radio interference
- Erratic headlights
- Turn signal malfunctions
- Brake light issues
- Dashboard failures requiring replacement

#### Critical Caveats

1. **Testing limitations**: Commission had to return borrowed vehicles in working order - didn't test to destruction point
2. **Age of vehicles**: Oldest vehicles in study are now 40+ years old; modern vehicles have far more electronics
3. **Field strength**: 50 kV/m is standard nuclear weapon estimate; Super-EMP weapons reach 200 kV/m
4. **Sample size**: 50 vehicles is statistically limited
5. **No public model identification**: Specific makes/models never released

### 3.3 EMP-Resistant Vehicle Characteristics

#### Ideal Characteristics

| Feature | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|
| **Points ignition** | Mechanical timing, no electronic module |
| **Carburetor** | Mechanical fuel metering, no injector ECU |

- Key fob/immobilizer components

**Note**: GM HEI ignition (1974-1975+) is known for RF sensitivity but can be replaced with mechanical points ignition.

### 3.5 Post-EMP Vehicle Expectations

Based on limited testing and engineering analysis:

| Vehicle Type | Expected Outcome |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-1970 mechanical** | High probability of operation |
| **1970s with HEI/electronic ignition** | May need replacement parts |

## 4. Grid-Down Electronics Strategy

### 4.1 Solar Power System Protection

#### System Vulnerabilities

|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Solar panels** | LOW | Panels themselves electrochemical, no chips |
| **Charge controllers** | HIGH | Contains electronics, no shielding |
| **Inverters** | HIGH | Complex electronics, primary failure point |
| **Batteries** | NONE | Electrochemical reaction, EMP-immune |
| **Wiring** | MEDIUM | Can act as antenna, induce surges |

#### Protection Strategy

**Three-Point Protection (Minimum)**:

- However: E1 can damage through antenna or power connection

#### Protection Methodology

**When NOT in use**:
1. Unplug from power
2. Disconnect from antenna
3. Cover with conductive cloth
4. Store in Faraday container

**When in use - layered protection**:
1. Surge protection strip (inadequate alone but helpful)
2. Broadband ferrite on power cord (near radio)
3. Antenna switch + 50-ohm dummy load in antenna path
4. High-speed arrestor (low VSWR, good grounding)
5. EMP Shield for radio (available for 200W, 500W, 1000W)

#### Equipment Recommendations

**Protects**: Home electrical, solar system basics, communications

#### Tier 3: Robust Protection (~$3,000-5,000 AUD)

Everything in Tier 2, plus:

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| EMP Shield (vehicle) | $550 |
| EMP Shield (generator) | $450 |
| EMP Shield (solar DC) | $400 |
| Sol-Ark or EMP-hardened inverter | $3,000+ |
| Spare vehicle ECU/parts | $500-1,000 |

| Professional Faraday bags (military grade) | $300 |
| Spectrum analyzer for testing | $300-500 |

**Protects**: Full system redundancy, vehicles, comprehensive comms

### 5.3 What's Overkill vs Necessary

#### Likely Overkill

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| **Room-size Faraday cage** | Cost prohibitive, nested containers adequate |
| **Multiple EMP Shields per circuit** | One at main panel protects all downstream |
| **Copper mesh everywhere** | Aluminum adequate for most frequencies |
| **Grounding DIY Faraday cages** | Can actually worsen protection |
| **Protecting all electronics** | Prioritize critical items only |

#### Definitely Necessary

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| **At least one sealed Faraday container** | Basic protection for critical comms |
| **Proper sealing (gaskets/tape)** | Unsealed container provides minimal protection |
| **Insulation inside containers** | Electronics touching metal = no protection |
| **Spare charge controller if solar** | Primary failure point, cheap insurance |
| **Testing your protection** | Untested = unknown effectiveness |

#### Gray Area (Depends on Situation)

| Item | Consider If |
|------|------------|
| **Whole-house EMP Shield** | Have significant electronics investment |
| **Vehicle protection** | Modern vehicle essential for transportation |
| **Backup vehicle** | Remote location, limited alternatives |
| **Solar system hardening** | Off-grid or backup power dependent |

### 5.4 Maintenance and Testing Schedule

#### Monthly

- [ ] Visual inspection of sealed containers (tape intact, no corrosion)
- [ ] Verify Faraday bags not damaged
- [ ] Check battery dates/condition (stored devices)

#### Quarterly

- [ ] Test electronics stored in Faraday containers (power on, function check)
- [ ] Rotate batteries
- [ ] Test radio equipment
- [ ] Verify surge protector indicator lights

#### Annually

- [ ] Full shielding effectiveness test (if equipment available)
- [ ] Replace any degraded sealing tape/gaskets
- [ ] Update stored data (maps, documents)
- [ ] Review and update spare parts inventory
- [ ] Test vehicle spare parts (bench test if possible)

#### After Any Lightning Strike or Surge Event

- [ ] Inspect all protection devices
- [ ] Replace any triggered surge protectors
- [ ] Test protected equipment

### 5.5 Integration with Overall Preparedness

#### EMP Protection Supports

| Capability | How EMP Protection Helps |
|------------|-------------------------|
| **Communications** | Protected radios maintain contact |
| **Power** | Protected solar components restore electricity |
| **Transportation** | Protected/prepared vehicles remain operational |
| **Security** | Night vision, motion sensors if protected |
| **Water** | Protected well pump controllers |
| **Medical** | Protected diagnostic devices |

#### EMP Protection Does NOT Replace

| Need | Still Required |
|------|----------------|
| **Water storage** | Electronics down doesn't create water |
| **Food storage** | Protected freezer means nothing without fuel |
| **Medical supplies** | Devices need consumables |
| **Security basics** | Physical security, community relationships |
| **Skills** | Knowing how to use equipment |
| **Manual backups** | Non-electric alternatives |
