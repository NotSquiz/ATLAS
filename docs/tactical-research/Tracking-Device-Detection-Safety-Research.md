## 1. The Problem of Tracking Device Abuse

### Statistics on Technology-Facilitated Stalking

Technology-facilitated abuse has become a significant threat to personal safety:

- **3.4 million** U.S. persons aged 16+ reported experiencing stalking in 2019, with **80%** indicating technology was involved ([Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47035))
- **14%** of stalking victims reported having their whereabouts tracked with an electronic device
- There was a **39% increase** in reports of location tracking with electronics from 2016 to 2019
- **72%** of domestic abuse cases involve technology-facilitated abuse (Refuge UK study)
- **97%** of domestic violence victims report technology being misused for abuse (Safety Net Project)
- AirTag-related stalking cases increased by **317%** in 2024 ([Cybernews](https://cybernews.com/editorial/airtag-stalking-explained/))
- Over **100 charges** filed in 2025 alone for AirTag-related offenses in Florida

### Types of Devices Misused

| Device Type | Cost | Detection Difficulty | Battery Life |
|-------------|------|---------------------|--------------|
| Apple AirTag | ~$45 | Medium (alerts exist) | 1+ year |
| Tile Trackers | $25-35 | Higher (less alerts) | 1 year |
| Samsung SmartTag | ~$30 | Medium | 1 year |
| Dedicated GPS Trackers | $50-300 | High (cellular) | Days-months |
| OBD-II Port Trackers | $50-150 | Low (visible) | Vehicle power |

### Why This Is a Growing Concern

- Tracking devices are inexpensive (some cost as little as $10)
- Easily purchased online or from major retailers
- Small size allows concealment in vehicles, bags, or personal items
- Low technical expertise required to deploy
- According to the NSW Crime Commission's Project Hakea report, over **37%** of individuals who purchased tracking devices were known to police, and **25%** had a record of domestic violence ([ACS Information Age](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2024/abusers-using-tracking-tech-to-stalk-victims.html))

### Domestic Violence Organization Guidance

> "GPS monitoring can be particularly dangerous if you are trying to leave an abusive relationship and don't want the abuser to be able to locate you."

## 2. Apple AirTag Safety Features

Apple has implemented multiple anti-stalking measures. Understanding these can help identify unwanted tracking.

### Built-in Anti-Stalking Alerts on iPhone

**How alerts work:**
- If an AirTag not registered to your Apple ID moves with you for an extended period, your iPhone sends a notification
- Alert message: "AirTag Found Moving With You" or "AirTag Detected Near You"
- Alerts come more quickly at night or when you're in frequently visited locations (home, work)
- Research found notifications can take **30 minutes to 9 hours** to appear ([Northeastern University](https://news.northeastern.edu/2023/10/23/apple-airtag-stalking-alert/))

**What to do when you receive an alert:**
1. Tap the alert to open details
2. Use "Play Sound" to locate the AirTag
3. Use **Precision Finding** (iPhone 11 and later) to get distance and direction
4. Tap "Learn About This AirTag" for the serial number
5. **Do not immediately disable** - document and consider contacting police first

### Audio Alerts

- AirTags emit a beeping noise after **8-24 hours** of being separated from the owner's device
- Sound plays when the AirTag is moved
- Designed to alert those without smartphones

### Android Detection App (Tracker Detect)

For Android users without automatic detection:

1. Download **Tracker Detect** from Google Play Store (free, from Apple)
2. Open the app and tap "Scan"
3. App scans for nearby AirTags separated from their owner
4. If found, you can make the AirTag play a sound

**Built-in Android Detection:**
- Newer Android versions include "Unknown Tracker Alerts" in Settings
- Navigate to: **Settings > Safety and emergency > Unknown tracker alerts**
- Enable "Allow alerts" for automatic scanning
- Currently supports AirTags, with more devices planned ([Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/automatic-smart-tag-detection-feature-android/))

### How to Disable an AirTag

If you determine an AirTag is being used to track you:

1. Press down on the stainless steel back cover
2. Twist counterclockwise to unlock
3. Remove the cover and take out the battery
4. The AirTag can no longer track your location

**Important**: Before disabling, photograph the device and its location for evidence.

## 3. Detecting Other Tracking Devices

### Tile and SmartTag Detection

**Tile Trackers:**
- Download the Tile app (iOS or Android)
- Use "Scan and Secure" feature to detect unknown Tiles nearby
- Limitation: Tiles with "Anti-Theft Mode" enabled will not appear in scans
- Tiles do not automatically play sounds when separated from owners
- To disable: Remove battery if possible, or wrap in multiple layers of foil

Source: [Tile Support](https://support.thetileapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410277493783-Tile-How-to-Handle-Unwanted-Tracking)

**Samsung SmartTag:**
- In SmartThings app, use "Unknown Tag Search"
- This feature must be manually enabled in Settings
- Works only on Samsung Galaxy devices

### Dedicated GPS Trackers

These are more sophisticated and harder to detect:

**Characteristics:**
- Transmit via cellular networks (4G/LTE)
- No Bluetooth, so won't appear in phone scanner apps
- Battery-powered or hardwired to vehicle
- Some transmit every 5-60 seconds; others less frequently

**What They Look Like:**
- Small black boxes (business card to cigarette pack size)
- May have magnetic backing for easy attachment
- Often waterproof/weatherproof housing
- External antenna may be visible
- Some plug directly into OBD-II port (under steering column)

### Common Hiding Locations on Vehicles

**Exterior locations:**
| Location | Access | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Wheel wells | Easy | Magnetic attachment common |
| Undercarriage | Medium | Near fuel tank, axles |
| Front/rear bumpers | Easy | Inside or behind bumper cover |
| Behind license plate | Easy | Quick installation |
| Roof rails/cargo area | Medium | If vehicle has roof rack |

**Interior locations:**
| Location | Access | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| OBD-II port | Easy | Below steering wheel, plug-in trackers |
| Under dashboard | Medium | Behind panels |
| Under seats | Easy | Attached to frame |

### Physical Search Recommendations

**Basic inspection:**
1. Use a flashlight to inspect all wheel wells thoroughly
2. Check behind bumpers (may require looking with a mirror)
3. Inspect the OBD-II port under the steering wheel
4. Check under all seats and floor mats
5. Examine the undercarriage if safely accessible
6. Look in trunk/boot including spare tire compartment

**Signs of tampering:**
- Dirt marks or handprints in unusual areas
- Disturbed dust patterns
- Loose trim panels
- Unfamiliar wires or devices

**For detection of cellular GPS trackers:**

NYU Tandon researchers developed a detection method using a **tinySA spectrum analyzer** (~$150):
- Monitors LTE IoT uplink frequency bands
- Can detect hidden GPS tracker signals within 3 feet
- If regular signal peaks appear during or after driving, likely indicates a tracker

## 4. What to Do If You Find a Tracker

### Step 1: Ensure Your Safety

- If you feel in immediate danger, call **000** (Australia) or **911** (US)
- Move to a safe location (trusted friend, public place, police station)
- Consider whether removing the device might alert the stalker

### Step 2: Do Not Destroy the Device

> **Critical**: Battery removal or tampering can destroy evidence. The device may contain information linking it to the person who placed it.

- Leave the device in place if possible
- If you must disable it, only remove the battery
- Do not throw it away, crush it, or damage it

### Step 3: Document the Device and Location

Before disturbing anything:
1. Take photographs of the device in its location
2. Take close-up photos showing any identifying marks or serial numbers
3. Note the exact date, time, and location found
4. If you received phone alerts, take screenshots
5. Write down any witnesses present

### Step 4: Contact Police - This Is a Crime

**Reporting options:**
- **Emergency**: Call 000 (Australia) / 911 (US)
- **Non-emergency**: Contact local police station
- Request to speak with a specialist officer trained in domestic violence or stalking

**Safety consideration from NPR:**
> "If the offender is monitoring the victim's actions and sees that the AirTag has now gone to the police station, that can escalate the situation. Finding a public place where you can safely contact police by phone and have an officer meet you might be a safer alternative."

Source: [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/18/1080944193/apple-airtags-theft-stalking-privacy-tech)

**What police can do:**
- Take a formal report
- Seize the device as evidence
- Request information from Apple/manufacturers (serial numbers can identify owners)
- Assist with protection orders

### Step 5: Seek Protective Orders

In Australia:
- **Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVO)** - can be applied for through Magistrates Court or requested through police
- Protection orders can specifically prohibit:
  - Locating or attempting to locate the victim
  - Monitoring movements or activities
  - Using technology to track or surveil

Maximum penalty for breaching a protection order in Queensland: **5 years imprisonment**
