# THE ATLAS PROTOCOL: Physical Architecture v1.2
**Subject:** 38M / Father / "Broken Sleep" Profile
**Status:** Active Rehab (Phase 1)
**Date:** January 7, 2026

## 0. Medical Diagnosis & Injury Context
**Primary Diagnosis:** **Grade 1 Supraspinatus Tendinopathy (Rotator Cuff)**
* **Mechanism:** "Double Crush" Injury.
    * *Chronic:* Repetitive overhead loading (Furniture Delivery).
    * *Acute:* Direct impact trauma (Soccer fall/shoulder barge).
* **Key Symptoms:**
    * Pain in "Zone B" (Deltoid insertion/side of arm).
    * Painful Arc at full overhead extension (near ear).
    * **Load Intolerance:** Pain on eccentric lowering of Pronated Pull-ups (Internal Rotation).
* **Contraindications (DO NOT DO):**
    * Wide-grip Pull-ups (Compresses the supraspinatus).
    * Upright Rows (Impairs subacromial space).
    * Sleeping on the injured side.

## 1. The Daily "Non-Negotiables" (Every Morning)
*Perform this routine daily (7 days/week). Ideally upon waking or before your first coffee. This signals the shoulder tendon to wake up and resets your posture.*

1.  **Shoulder "Painkiller" Isometrics:**
    * **Doorframe Ext. Rotation:** Stand in doorframe, elbow at 90° tucked in ribs. Press back of hand into frame (50% effort). **Hold 45s. Rest. Repeat 2x.**
    * **Towel Crush:** Rolled towel between elbow and ribs. Squeeze elbow into side. **Hold 10s. Repeat 5x.**
2.  **Back/Hip Reset:**
    * **Cat-Cow:** 10 slow reps (Inhale up, Exhale down).
    * **World's Greatest Stretch:** 5 reps per side.
3.  **Visual/Circadian:**
    * **Morning Sunlight:** 5-10 mins outside (no sunglasses).
    * *Optional:* 670nm Red Light on eyes (3 mins).

## 2. Executive Philosophy: "Resilient Optimization"
**Source:** ATLAS Protocol

> "For a father of a 16-month-old, the primary adversary to longevity is not just cellular senescence, but the systemic inflammation caused by sleep fragmentation."

* **The Objective:** Decouple biological age from chronological age while managing fatigue.
* **The Strategy:** Dynamic Allostasis. We do not force high intensity on low-recovery days.
* **The Metric:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) & Resting Heart Rate (RHR) via Garmin Forerunner 165.

## 3. The Weekly Grid (3 Strength / 3 Cardio)

| Day | System Focus | Activity Type | Rehab Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MON** | **Strength A** | Lower Body + Posterior Chain | Hip Mobility & Ankle Stability |
| **TUE** | **Cardio I** | Zone 2 Base (60-70% Max HR) | Mitochondrial Efficiency |
| **WED** | **Strength B** | Upper Body Rehab (Push/Pull) | **Shoulder Rehab** (No Vertical Pulling) |
| **THU** | **Cardio II** | Mobility / Flow / Pilates | "HUSTL" Style / Back Decompression |
| **FRI** | **Strength C** | Full Body Functional + Neck | Posture & Neck Strength |
| **SAT** | **Cardio III** | VO2 Max (Vigorous) | 4x4 Intervals |
| **SUN** | **Recovery** | NSDR / Family Walk | System Reset |

## 4. The "Traffic Light" Logic (Garmin API)
*Before training, check Garmin "Body Battery" or "HRV Status".*

### 🟢 GREEN DAY (High Readiness)
* **Criteria:** Sleep > 6.5hrs, HRV "Balanced", RHR < 55bpm.
* **Action:** Execute full programmed intensity. Push weights on main lifts.

### 🔴 RED DAY (Low Readiness)
* **Criteria:** Sleep < 5.5hrs, HRV "Unbalanced", RHR Elevated (>5bpm baseline).
* **Action:** **Protocol Override.**
    * Skip Heavy Lifting.
    * Do **Zone 2 Walk** only.
    * Perform **NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest)** for 20 mins.

## 5. Phase 1 Workouts (Weeks 1–4)

### MON: Strength A (Legs & Back Support)
*Goal: Fix "Aching Back" by strengthening glutes/hamstrings and mobilizing hips.*

1.  **Warm-up:** *Perform Daily Routine (Section 1).*
2.  **Ankle Rehab:** Single-leg balance on pillow (Eyes open -> Eyes closed). **3 x 30s per leg.**
3.  **Trap Bar (or DB) Deadlift:** **3 x 8 reps.**
    * *Cue: Hinge hips back. Do NOT squat the weight. Feel hamstrings.*
4.  **Split Squats (Bodyweight/Light DB):** **3 x 10 per leg.**
    * *Why: Opens tight hip flexors dynamically.*
5.  **Bird-Dog:** **3 x 10 per side.**
    * *Cue: Brace core. Do not let lower back arch. Essential for back pain.*
6.  **Cool Down:** Pigeon Stretch (2 mins/side).

### WED: Strength B (Shoulder Repair - Grade 1 Focus)
*Goal: Re-align Supraspinatus collagen. **NO PULL-UPS/CHIN-UPS YET.***

1.  **Warm-up:** *Perform Daily Routine (Section 1).*
2.  **Floor Press (Dumbbells):** **3 x 12 reps.**
    * *Why: Floor stops elbows from going too deep and straining the capsule.*
3.  **Chest-Supported Row (Incline Bench):** **3 x 12 reps.**
    * *Why: Supports lower back. Focus on squeezing shoulder blades DOWN and back.*
4.  **Side-Lying Wiper (Eccentric Focus):** **3 x 10 reps.**
    * *The Healer:* Use light weight (1-2kg). Lift up with help, lower down SLOWLY (4 seconds) on your own.
5.  **Band Pull-Aparts:** **3 x 20 reps.**
    * *Cue: Palms up. Don't shrug shoulders.*

### FRI: Strength C (Full Body + Neck)
*Goal: Functional carrying capacity and Blueprint neck standards.*

1.  **Warm-up:** *Perform Daily Routine (Section 1).*
2.  **Goblet Squats (Heels Elevated if needed):** **3 x 12 reps.**
    * *Why: Front load forces upright posture, relieving back stress.*
3.  **Landmine Press (or Kneeling Single-Arm DB Press):** **3 x 10 per side.**
    * *Why: Pressing at an angle (not straight up) is safer for impingement.*
4.  **Suitcase Carries:** **3 sets x 30 meters.**
    * *Cue: Heavy DB in one hand. Walk perfectly straight. Anti-lateral flexion.*
5.  **Neck Harness (Flexion/Extension):** **2 x 15 reps (Light).**
    * *Bryan Johnson Standard:* Start very light. Control the tempo.

* **Duration:** 45–60 mins.
* **Modality:** Jog, Bike, or Ruck.
* **Target:** Heart Rate 60–70% Max (Conversation pace).
* **Why:** Increases mitochondrial density and clears lactate.

### THU: Active Mobility ("The Anti-Aging Flow")

## 7. Progression Rules
* **Week 1-4:** Follow above. Focus on "feeling" the muscle, not moving weight.
* **Week 5:** Re-test Shoulder Pain. If <2/10, introduce Neutral Grip Chin-ups (Eccentric only).
