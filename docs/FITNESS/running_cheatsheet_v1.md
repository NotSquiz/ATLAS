## 🏃 WALK-JOG PROGRESSION (Phase 2A)

| Level | Protocol | Total | Running % |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **1** | 0.1mi walk / 0.1mi jog × 10 | 2 mi | 50% |
| **2** | 0.1mi walk / 0.2mi jog | 2 mi | 67% |
| **3** | 0.1mi walk / 0.3mi jog | 2 mi | 75% |
| **4** | 0.1mi walk / 0.4mi jog | 2 mi | 80% |

| **8** | Run/jog alternate 0.25mi | 3 mi | Varied |

### Progression Rules
- ✅ **Advance:** Complete level pain-free, no swelling 24h post
- 🟡 **Stay same level:** Sore AFTER workout
- 🔽 **Drop 1 level:** Sore DURING workout, take 1 day off
- 🔽🔽 **Drop 2 levels:** Sore during WARMUP, take 2 days off

### Frequency
- Every other day (48h minimum between)
- Max 4 sessions per week
- Treadmill preferred initially

## 💡 REMEMBER

> "Running is coming back - and it's coming back STRONG. We're not skipping it, we're EARNING it."

The same patience that builds your aerobic base through cycling will build bulletproof ankles through progressive running.

**Trust the gates. Pass the tests. Own the sprint.**
